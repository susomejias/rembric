# plugin-session-protocol Specification

## Purpose

TBD - created by archiving change fix-session-summary-all-clients. Update Purpose after archive.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Sessions MUST converge on a non-null summary when the agent cooperates OR the transcript is reachable

Every closed session in the dashboard SHALL display a non-null `summary` whenever ANY of the following held during its lifetime:

- The agent called `memory.session_summary({summary, title?})` at any point.
- The session compacted (Claude Code only) and the model produced a compact summary the post-compact instruction injection could refer to.
- The session reached `SessionEnd` (Claude Code) or successive `Stop` invocations (Codex) with a readable `transcript_path` containing at least one assistant turn.
- The session ran under Hermes Agent (`on_session_end(messages)` with non-empty messages).
- The session ran under opencode and **either** the agent called `memory.session_summary({summary, title?})` voluntarily, **or** opencode's `server.instance.disposed` event fired with a non-empty per-session transcript accumulator. The opencode plugin POSTs `/api/<slug>/sessions/<id>/summary` with `final:false` for every known top-level session at dispose time, populated from the in-memory `sessionMessages` Map fed by `chat.message` and `message.updated` handlers during the session. `status` stays `'active'` until `abandonStale` flips it (the plugin never POSTs `/end`).

A session SHALL be considered to have "converged on a summary" if its `sessions.summary` column is non-null. Coverage in the contrary case (transcript file missing, hook scripts never fired, agent ignored every instruction, Hermes messages list empty, opencode hard-crashed before `server.instance.disposed` could fire) is OUT of scope — these are degenerate states the dashboard surfaces as "no summary captured" without crashing.

#### Scenario: Claude Code short session with cooperating agent

- **GIVEN** a Claude Code session of N user prompts (N ≥ 1, no compact)
- **AND** the agent called `memory.session_summary({summary, title})` at any point before stop
- **WHEN** the user closes the session and `SessionEnd` fires
- **THEN** `sessions.summary` SHALL be the model-authored content (preserved because `final:true` blocks the bash overwrite)
- **AND** `sessions.title` SHALL be the model-authored title
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL be `'ended'`

#### Scenario: Claude Code short session with non-cooperating agent

- **GIVEN** a Claude Code session of N user prompts (N ≥ 1, no compact)
- **AND** the agent never called `memory.session_summary`
- **WHEN** the user closes the session and `SessionEnd` fires with a non-empty `transcript_path` JSONL
- **THEN** `sessions.summary` SHALL be the bash fallback's formatted transcript (oldest-first, role: content, truncated to 19500 chars)
- **AND** `sessions.title` SHALL be derived from the first non-empty assistant message in the transcript, truncated to 100 chars
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL be `'ended'`

#### Scenario: Codex short session captures summary via per-turn Stop

- **GIVEN** a Codex session of N turns (N ≥ 1, no compact)
- **AND** every `Stop` hook fired and posted `/summary` with the running transcript
- **WHEN** the user closes the Codex CLI
- **THEN** `sessions.summary` SHALL contain the most recent transcript (from the final `Stop` of the session)
- **AND** `sessions.title` SHALL be derived from the first non-empty assistant message
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL be `'active'` until `abandonStale` flips it to `'abandoned'` (Codex has no SessionEnd signal — this is the expected steady state)

#### Scenario: Hermes short session

- **GIVEN** a Hermes session of N turns (N ≥ 1, no compress)
- **WHEN** the user exits and `on_session_end(messages)` fires
- **THEN** the provider SHALL POST `/end {summary: _format_transcript(messages), title, final:false}`
- **AND** `sessions.summary` SHALL be non-null
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL be `'ended'`

#### Scenario: opencode short session with cooperating agent

- **GIVEN** an opencode session of N user prompts (N ≥ 1, no compact)
- **AND** the agent called `memory.session_summary({summary, title})` via MCP at any point (sets `summary_final=true` server-side)
- **WHEN** the user closes opencode (firing `server.instance.disposed`)
- **THEN** the plugin's dispose handler POSTs `/sessions/<id>/summary` with the accumulated transcript and `final:false`
- **AND** the server applies the precedence rule and DOES NOT overwrite the existing summary (because `summary_final=true`)
- **AND** `sessions.summary` SHALL remain the model-authored content
- **AND** `sessions.title` SHALL remain the model-authored title
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL transition to `'ended'` only if the cooperating `memory.session_summary` call routed through the MCP server's terminating path; otherwise stays `'active'` until `abandonStale` flips it

#### Scenario: opencode short session with non-cooperating agent

- **GIVEN** an opencode session of N user prompts (N ≥ 1, no compact)
- **AND** the agent never called `memory.session_summary`
- **WHEN** the user closes opencode (firing `server.instance.disposed`)
- **THEN** the plugin's dispose handler POSTs `/sessions/<id>/summary` for every known session with body `{summary: <role-prefixed transcript truncated to 19500 chars>, title?: <first user text truncated to 100 chars>, final: false}`
- **AND** `sessions.summary` SHALL be the accumulated transcript (NOT `NULL` — this is the key behaviour change vs the pre-0.8.0 plugin)
- **AND** `sessions.title` SHALL be the derived title when the accumulator had at least one user entry; OMITTED from the body otherwise (server leaves the placeholder `basename(cwd) · HH:MM UTC` in place)
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL be `'active'` until `abandonStale` flips it to `'abandoned'`
- **AND** the dashboard surfaces the session row with the transcript visible immediately after close

#### Scenario: opencode hard-crash before dispose fires

- **GIVEN** opencode is killed via SIGKILL (or OS-level crash) before `server.instance.disposed` can fire
- **WHEN** the operator opens the dashboard
- **THEN** the session row's `summary` SHALL be `NULL` (no fallback exists for this scenario — same risk Claude/Codex hooks carry)
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL be `'active'` until `abandonStale` flips it
- **AND** the dashboard surfaces the session as "no summary captured" without crashing

#### Scenario: opencode session survives compaction with cooperating agent

- **GIVEN** an opencode session approaching the context window limit
- **WHEN** `experimental.session.compacting` fires
- **THEN** the plugin appends the recall-context block AND the "FIRST ACTION REQUIRED: call memory.session_summary" reminder to `output.context`
- **AND** the next agent (post-compaction) reads that reminder and calls `memory.session_summary({summary: <compacted summary content>, title})`
- **AND** the resulting row in `sessions` has the compacted summary as `summary` and a non-null `title`

### Requirement: Write precedence for summary and title MUST be expressed via a `final:boolean` flag

The server SHALL accept summary/title writes carrying an optional `final:boolean` flag (default `false`). Behaviour:

- A `final:true` write SHALL persist summary/title and SHALL mark the row's `summary_final` and `title_final` columns as `true`.
- A subsequent `final:false` write SHALL be silently ignored if the corresponding `*_final` flag is already `true` for that field.
- A subsequent `final:true` write SHALL replace the prior value (the latest cooperating writer wins; this matters when an admin tool eventually wants to overwrite).
- Non-final writes overwrite earlier non-final writes (last non-final wins).

`memory.session_summary` (MCP) SHALL always send `final:true`. Hook bash/Python fallbacks SHALL always send `final:false`. The placeholder written at SessionStart (`basename(cwd) · HH:MM UTC`) SHALL be `final:false`.

#### Scenario: Model summary preserved when bash fallback fires later

- **GIVEN** session `<S>` whose `summary` was written via `memory.session_summary({summary: "A", title: "B"})` (so `summary_final` and `title_final` are both `true`)
- **WHEN** the SessionEnd bash hook POSTs `/end {summary: "X", title: "Y", final: false}`
- **THEN** `sessions.summary` SHALL remain `"A"` and `sessions.title` SHALL remain `"B"`
- **AND** the call SHALL still transition `status` to `'ended'`

#### Scenario: Bash fallback writes title because model didn't

- **GIVEN** session `<S>` whose `title` is the placeholder `"rembric · 22:14"` (written at SessionStart with `final:false`) and whose `summary` is null
- **WHEN** the SessionEnd bash hook POSTs `/end {summary: "raw transcript", title: "Fix Stop bug", final: false}`
- **THEN** both `summary` and `title` SHALL be overwritten with the bash values (non-final overwrites non-final)

#### Scenario: Last non-final write wins among same-priority writers

- **GIVEN** a Codex session where Stop has fired twice, posting `/summary {summary: "turn1+turn2 transcript", final:false}` after turn 2
- **WHEN** Stop fires for turn 3 and posts `/summary {summary: "turn1+turn2+turn3 transcript", final:false}`
- **THEN** `sessions.summary` SHALL be the turn3 version

### Requirement: Initial title MUST be written at SessionStart as a recognisable placeholder

When `/api/<slug>/sessions` creates a new session row (`created:true`), the server SHALL write a title of the form `basename(cwd) · HH:MM UTC` using the request's `cwd` field (or a hardcoded fallback `"session"` when `cwd` is unset). The time component is rendered in UTC with two-digit hour and minute. The title SHALL be persisted with `title_final = false` so any subsequent non-placeholder write overwrites it.

When `cwd` is missing or fails to parse, the placeholder SHALL be `"session · HH:MM UTC"`.

#### Scenario: Placeholder title written on session creation

- **WHEN** a client POSTs `{id, cwd: "/Users/jane/projects/rembric"}` to `/api/foo/sessions` at 22:14 UTC and the row does not exist
- **THEN** the inserted row SHALL have `title = "rembric · 22:14 UTC"` and `title_final = false`

#### Scenario: Placeholder when cwd is unparseable

- **WHEN** a client POSTs `{id}` (no `cwd` field)
- **THEN** the inserted row SHALL have `title = "session · HH:MM UTC"`

#### Scenario: Placeholder is overwritten by any later non-final write

- **GIVEN** a session with the placeholder title
- **WHEN** any non-placeholder write (model `memory.session_summary({title})`, Hermes `on_session_end`, bash SessionEnd) lands
- **THEN** the title SHALL be replaced with the new value (because both writes are `final:false` and last-write-wins among non-finals)

### Requirement: The protocol nudge MUST be in `initialize.instructions` to cover all three clients uniformly

The MCP server's `initialize.instructions` string (loaded into the model's system prompt on connect) SHALL include a sentence directing the model to call `memory.session_summary` with `{title, summary}` before "done" / end of work. The sentence SHALL:

- Be present in both the path-scoped and path-less variants of `initialize.instructions`.
- Stay within the existing 800-character cap enforced by `instructions.test.ts`.
- Describe the title constraint (≤100 chars, descriptive of what was worked on) and the summary structure (Goal · Discoveries · Accomplished · Next Steps · Files).

This nudge is the only mechanism that covers the case where Codex CLI cannot inject post-compact instructions and where short sessions never compact. All three clients ship with the same MCP server reachable, so this is the single deployment surface.

#### Scenario: Instructions string contains the protocol nudge

- **WHEN** an MCP client retrieves `initialize.instructions` from either `/mcp` or `/mcp/<slug>`
- **THEN** the string SHALL contain the substring `memory.session_summary` AND the substring `title` AND the substring `before` (referring to "before 'done'" / "before finishing")

#### Scenario: Instructions string respects the 800-char cap

- **WHEN** the test suite runs `instructions.test.ts` against both variants
- **THEN** both outputs SHALL be ≤800 characters

### Requirement: Per-client lifecycle mapping MUST be honoured

The cross-client write contract maps lifecycle events to HTTP endpoints as follows. Implementations SHALL conform; divergences from this mapping SHALL be considered specification violations.

| Client      | Lifecycle event                                   | HTTP call                                                     | `final` |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Claude Code | `SessionStart` (`startup\|resume\|clear`)         | `POST /sessions {id, cwd, agent}` (placeholder title)         | n/a     |
| Claude Code | `SessionStart` (`compact`)                        | stdout instruction to model; no HTTP                          | n/a     |
| Claude Code | `SessionEnd`                                      | `POST /end {summary, title, final:false}`                     | false   |
| Codex CLI   | `SessionStart` (any)                              | `POST /sessions {id, cwd, agent}`                             | n/a     |
| Codex CLI   | `Stop` (every turn)                               | `POST /summary {summary, title, final:false}` + stdout `'{}'` | false   |
| Hermes      | `initialize`                                      | `POST /sessions {id, cwd, agent}`                             | n/a     |
| Hermes      | `on_pre_compress(messages)`                       | `POST /summary {summary, final:false}`                        | false   |
| Hermes      | `on_session_switch(new_id, parent_id)`            | `POST /end old + POST /sessions new`                          | n/a     |
| Hermes      | `on_session_end(messages)`                        | `POST /end {summary, title, final:false}`                     | false   |
| Any (model) | `memory.session_summary({summary, title?})` (MCP) | internal write (no HTTP) with `final:true`                    | true    |

The Claude Code `Stop` hook SHALL NOT be wired in `plugin/hooks/hooks.json`. The Claude Code `pre-compact.sh` script SHALL NOT exist. The Codex `pre-compact.sh` reference in `hooks.codex.json` SHALL be removed (there is no equivalent event in Codex).

#### Scenario: Claude Code hooks.json contains the mapped events

- **WHEN** `plugin/hooks/hooks.json` is loaded
- **THEN** the `hooks` object SHALL contain entries for `SessionStart` (with two matcher groups — one for `startup|resume|clear`, one for `compact`), `UserPromptSubmit`, and `SessionEnd`
- **AND** the `hooks` object SHALL NOT contain a `Stop` entry
- **AND** the `hooks` object SHALL NOT contain a `PreCompact` entry

#### Scenario: Codex hooks.codex.json contains the mapped events

- **WHEN** `plugin/hooks/hooks.codex.json` is loaded
- **THEN** the `hooks` object SHALL contain entries for `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, and `Stop`
- **AND** the `hooks` object SHALL NOT contain a `PreCompact` entry
- **AND** the `Stop` script SHALL emit `'{}'` to stdout (Codex requires JSON on Stop stdout — plain text is invalid per docs)

#### Scenario: Hermes plugin.yaml declares the lifecycle methods

- **WHEN** `plugin/.hermes-plugin/plugin.yaml` is loaded
- **THEN** the `hooks` array SHALL contain `on_pre_compress`, `on_session_end`, and `on_session_switch`

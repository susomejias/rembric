# sessions Specification

## Purpose

Defines the session model used to group an agent's tool calls into bounded units of work: append-only lifecycle, scope binding to a single token and at most one project, optional anchoring of memories to a session of origin, summary persistence, explicit-slug overrides, switching constraints, and recovery of in-flight sessions on server restart.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Sessions MUST be append-only

The system SHALL never physically delete a session row and SHALL never mutate the `agent`, `token_id`, `started_at`, or `project_id` of an existing session. Lifecycle changes are expressed exclusively by transitioning the `status` column among `active`, `ended`, and `abandoned`, and by writing the `ended_at` and `summary` columns at most once per session.

The `deleted_at` column is exempt from immutability: it SHALL transition from NULL to a timestamp (soft-delete) or from a timestamp back to NULL (undelete) any number of times. Both transitions SHALL be guarded by the cross-token rule that already protects `end` and `summarize`, unless the caller is an operator-facing surface (CLI or dashboard) that sets `adminBypass: true`.

The `id` column is set exactly once at insert time. It MAY originate from a client (via `POST /api/<slug>/sessions` or `start({id})`) or be server-minted (via `memory.session_start` without an explicit id). Once written it SHALL NOT be UPDATEd.

#### Scenario: Code path attempts to physically delete a session

- **WHEN** any service or migration emits a `DELETE FROM agent_sessions` statement
- **THEN** a CI invariant test SHALL fail and the build SHALL be rejected

#### Scenario: Code path attempts to mutate an immutable session column

- **WHEN** any service emits an `UPDATE agent_sessions SET agent = ?`, `UPDATE agent_sessions SET started_at = ?`, or `UPDATE agent_sessions SET id = ?` statement
- **THEN** a CI invariant test SHALL fail and the build SHALL be rejected

#### Scenario: Two `memory.session_end` (or `/api/.../end`) calls for the same session id

- **WHEN** `memory.session_end` (MCP) or `POST /api/<slug>/sessions/:id/end` (HTTP) is called twice on the same `(token_id, id)`
- **THEN** the second call SHALL fail with code `session_already_ended` and SHALL NOT mutate `ended_at` or `summary`

#### Scenario: deleted_at transitions are tracked

- **WHEN** an operator soft-deletes a session and later undeletes it
- **THEN** `deleted_at` SHALL transition NULL → timestamp → NULL and SHALL be the only column that may revisit its initial value

### Requirement: `AgentSessionsService.start()` MUST accept a client-provided id and be idempotent on that id

The service method `start(input: { tokenId, projectId, agent, description?, id? })` SHALL accept an optional `id?: string`. When `id` is supplied:

1. The service SHALL validate `id` against the regex `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{8,128}$`. Non-matching ids SHALL be rejected with `DomainError('invalid_input', <message naming the contract>)`.
2. The service SHALL `SELECT` the row by `id`. If found AND its `token_id` matches the calling token: return the existing row with `created: false` semantics. The service SHALL NOT mutate `status`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `summary`, `project_id`, `agent`, or `description` on idempotent hits.
3. If the row was found but its `token_id` does NOT match the calling token: throw `DomainError('id_collision', <message>)`. (Theoretically impossible with UUIDs/ULIDs; this is defense-in-depth.)
4. If no row was found: `INSERT` with the provided id and return with `created: true` semantics.

When `id` is NOT supplied, the service SHALL mint a ULID as today and SHALL return `created: true`. This preserves backwards compatibility with `memory.session_start` (MCP) which does not pass an id.

#### Scenario: start() with a valid client id inserts a new row

- **WHEN** `start({ tokenId: 't1', projectId: 'p1', agent: 'claude-code', id: 'sess-abc12345' })` is called and no row exists for id `'sess-abc12345'`
- **THEN** a new row SHALL be inserted with `id = 'sess-abc12345'`, `token_id = 't1'`, `status = 'active'`
- **AND** the returned value SHALL include `created: true`

#### Scenario: start() with the same client id is idempotent for the same token

- **GIVEN** a previous successful `start({ tokenId: 't1', id: 'sess-abc12345', projectId: 'p1' })`
- **WHEN** `start({ tokenId: 't1', id: 'sess-abc12345', projectId: 'p1' })` is called again
- **THEN** the second call SHALL return the existing row with `created: false`
- **AND** `started_at` SHALL be unchanged from the original insert
- **AND** the table SHALL still contain exactly one row for that id

#### Scenario: start() rejects cross-token id collision

- **GIVEN** a row exists for `(token_id='t1', id='shared-id-12345')`
- **WHEN** `start({ tokenId: 't2', id: 'shared-id-12345', projectId: 'p1' })` is called
- **THEN** the service SHALL throw `DomainError('id_collision', ...)` and SHALL NOT insert or mutate any row
- **AND** the original row for `('t1', 'shared-id-12345')` SHALL be untouched

#### Scenario: start() rejects malformed ids

- **WHEN** `start({ tokenId: 't1', id: 'x', projectId: 'p1' })` is called (too short — fails regex)
- **THEN** the call SHALL throw `DomainError('invalid_input', ...)` and SHALL NOT insert a row

- **WHEN** `start({ tokenId: 't1', id: 'has spaces', projectId: 'p1' })` is called
- **THEN** the call SHALL throw `DomainError('invalid_input', ...)`

- **WHEN** `start({ tokenId: 't1', id: 'A'.repeat(129), projectId: 'p1' })` is called
- **THEN** the call SHALL throw `DomainError('invalid_input', ...)`

#### Scenario: start() without explicit id preserves ULID-minting behavior

- **WHEN** `start({ tokenId: 't1', projectId: 'p1', agent: 'mcp' })` is called (no `id`)
- **THEN** the service SHALL mint a ULID via `ulid()`, insert, and return a row whose `id` is that ULID
- **AND** the returned value SHALL include `created: true`

### Requirement: A session belongs to exactly one token and at most one project

Every session row SHALL carry a `token_id` referencing an existing row in `tokens`. When a session is registered through a path-scoped MCP connection (`/mcp/<slug>`) or via `X-Rembric-Project`, the session row SHALL carry the resolved `project_id`. When the session is registered through `/mcp` with no project header, `project_id` SHALL be null and the session is global-scope.

#### Scenario: A token is revoked while one of its sessions is active

- **WHEN** a token is revoked and a session bound to it is still `status = 'active'`
- **THEN** subsequent tool calls reusing that session id SHALL be rejected with `token_revoked` (existing auth behavior) and the session row SHALL be transitioned to `status = 'abandoned'` on the next request

#### Scenario: A session is started without a project but the token is project-scoped

- **WHEN** `memory.session_start` is called on `/mcp` (no project) with a token whose scope is `project:<id>`
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `forbidden` and SHALL NOT insert a session row

### Requirement: Memories MAY anchor to a session of origin

The `memory` table SHALL gain a nullable `session_id` column referencing `sessions.id`. The `confirmations` table SHALL gain the same nullable column.

#### Scenario: An agent saves a memory after `memory.session_start`

- **WHEN** the active MCP transport session has a registered Rembric session for `(token, project)` and `memory.save` is called without an explicit `session_id` argument
- **THEN** the inserted row's `session_id` SHALL be set to the active Rembric session id

#### Scenario: An agent saves a memory without calling `memory.session_start`

- **WHEN** `memory.save` is called and no Rembric session is active for `(token, project, mcp-session-id)`
- **THEN** the inserted row's `session_id` SHALL be null and the call SHALL succeed (backwards compatibility)

#### Scenario: A pre-existing memory row predates this change

- **WHEN** the migration that adds `memory.session_id` runs against an existing data file
- **THEN** existing rows SHALL retain `session_id = NULL` and SHALL remain queryable through every existing tool unchanged

### Requirement: A session summary MUST follow the documented structure

When `memory.session_summary` is called, the submitted `summary` SHALL be persisted verbatim in the session row's `summary` column. The tool description SHALL document the canonical structure (Goal / Discoveries / Accomplished / Next Steps / Relevant Files), but the server SHALL NOT enforce the layout — agents may submit free-form text.

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` is called with a non-empty summary

- **WHEN** the agent submits a `summary` string of length >= 1
- **THEN** the server SHALL set `summary`, `ended_at`, and `status = 'ended'` atomically and SHALL return `{ ok: true, sessionId, endedAt }`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` is called with an empty summary

- **WHEN** the agent submits a `summary` string of length 0 or only whitespace
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `invalid_input` and SHALL NOT mutate the row

### Requirement: `memory.session_start` MAY accept an explicit project slug

The `memory.session_start` tool SHALL accept an optional `project?: string` argument (a slug, not a path). When provided, it SHALL override any auto-detected scope from `roots/list` but SHALL respect the connection-level scope from a path-scoped URL (`/mcp/<slug>`). The slug resolution rules of the `projects` capability apply: unknown slugs reject with `project_not_found` (with `suggestedSlugs[]`), and creation requires the agent to use `project.use({slug, autocreate: true})` separately first.

#### Scenario: `memory.session_start` with an explicit valid slug on `/mcp`

- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.session_start({agent: 'claude-code', project: 'rembric'})` on a `/mcp` (no path slug) connection and the slug exists
- **THEN** the inserted session row SHALL have `project_id` set to that project, regardless of any `roots`-derived suggestion

#### Scenario: `memory.session_start` with an explicit slug on `/mcp/<slug>` mismatching the path

- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.session_start({project: 'api'})` on a connection at `/mcp/rembric`
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `scope_locked` and a message clarifying that the connection is path-scoped to `'rembric'`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_start` with an unknown slug

- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.session_start({project: 'unknown-slug'})` and the slug does not exist
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `project_not_found` and `suggestedSlugs[]` in the payload; no session row SHALL be inserted

### Requirement: A project switch MUST NOT happen while a session is active

When a session is `status = 'active'` for the current MCP transport, the `project.use` tool SHALL refuse to switch the active project — even with `confirmSwitch: true` — until the session is closed via `memory.session_end` or `memory.session_summary`.

#### Scenario: `project.use` switch attempted with active session

- **WHEN** the agent calls `project.use({slug: 'api', confirmSwitch: true})` while a session is active in project `'rembric'`
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `session_active_must_end` and a payload `{ activeSessionId, currentSlug, targetSlug }`

#### Scenario: Closing a session then switching

- **GIVEN** an active session in project `'rembric'`
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.session_summary({summary})` and then `project.use({slug: 'api', confirmSwitch: true})`
- **THEN** the second call SHALL succeed with `switched: true` and `previousSlug: 'rembric'`

### Requirement: Server restart MUST mark in-flight sessions as abandoned

In-process session routing state (`mcp-session-id` → active Rembric session id) is not persisted. On startup, the server SHALL scan for sessions with `status = 'active'` whose `started_at` is older than the configured `SESSION_ABANDON_AFTER_MS` (default `24h`) and transition them to `status = 'abandoned'` with `ended_at = now`.

#### Scenario: Server restarts while a session is active

- **WHEN** the server process exits while a session has `status = 'active'` and the next startup reads a `started_at` older than 24 hours
- **THEN** the session SHALL be flipped to `status = 'abandoned'` and a row in the startup log SHALL record the transition

#### Scenario: Server restarts within the abandon window

- **WHEN** the server restarts and an `active` session is younger than 24h
- **THEN** the row SHALL be left `active`; the next tool call referencing it SHALL be accepted (the agent can `session_end` it explicitly or continue)

### Requirement: Sessions MAY be soft-deleted while preserving the audit trail

The `agent_sessions` table SHALL gain a nullable column `deleted_at TIMESTAMP`. A row with `deleted_at IS NOT NULL` is _soft-deleted_: it remains physically present, its `id` continues to satisfy every existing `memory.session_id` foreign-key reference, but it is hidden from default-visible listings.

`AgentSessionsService` SHALL expose:

- `softDelete(sessionId, {tokenId?, adminBypass?})`: sets `deleted_at` to `now()`. Calling this on an already-deleted row SHALL be a no-op that returns the existing row (idempotent). Without `adminBypass`, the caller's `tokenId` SHALL match the row's `token_id`; mismatches SHALL be rejected with `forbidden`.
- `undelete(sessionId, {adminBypass?})`: clears `deleted_at`. Only admin (operator-facing) callers may invoke this; agent-facing callers SHALL NOT have access.

`AgentSessionsService.list(...)` and `recentForContext(...)` SHALL apply `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` by default. `list(...)` SHALL accept an `includeDeleted: true` option to surface deleted rows. `recentForContext` SHALL NOT accept such an option — memory-context callers SHALL never see deleted sessions.

`AgentSessionsService.findById(...)` SHALL NOT filter on `deleted_at`. The detail surface must still be able to open and act on (e.g. undelete) a soft-deleted row.

#### Scenario: softDelete sets deleted_at and hides the row from default list

- **GIVEN** an active session with `id = <S>` whose `deleted_at` is NULL
- **WHEN** the operator calls `softDelete(<S>, {adminBypass: true})`
- **THEN** the row's `deleted_at` SHALL be set to the current timestamp
- **AND** a subsequent `list()` SHALL NOT include the row
- **AND** a subsequent `list({includeDeleted: true})` SHALL include the row
- **AND** `findById(<S>)` SHALL still return the row

#### Scenario: softDelete is idempotent

- **GIVEN** a session whose `deleted_at` is already set
- **WHEN** the operator calls `softDelete` on it again
- **THEN** the call SHALL succeed and SHALL NOT modify `deleted_at`
- **AND** the returned row SHALL be the existing soft-deleted row

#### Scenario: undelete clears deleted_at

- **GIVEN** a soft-deleted session
- **WHEN** the operator calls `undelete` on it with `adminBypass: true`
- **THEN** `deleted_at` SHALL transition back to NULL
- **AND** the row SHALL re-appear in the default list

#### Scenario: Memories anchored to a soft-deleted session preserve their session_id

- **GIVEN** a memory whose `session_id` references session `<S>`
- **WHEN** session `<S>` is soft-deleted
- **THEN** the memory's `session_id` SHALL remain unchanged and SHALL continue to point at `<S>`

### Requirement: The CLI MUST expose `rembric session delete <id>` and `--include-deleted`

The CLI SHALL gain:

- `rembric session delete <id>`: soft-deletes the session by calling `softDelete(id, {adminBypass: true})`. SHALL print the updated row as JSON on success. SHALL exit with non-zero status and a stderr message when the session is not found.
- `rembric session list --include-deleted`: surfaces soft-deleted rows alongside active ones. The `--table` rendering SHALL include a `(deleted)` annotation in the status column for deleted rows.

#### Scenario: session delete soft-deletes the row

- **GIVEN** a Rembric database containing a session with `id = <S>` whose `deleted_at` is NULL
- **WHEN** the operator runs `rembric session delete <S>`
- **THEN** the command SHALL exit `0` and print JSON containing `id = <S>` and a non-null `deletedAt`
- **AND** the row SHALL NOT appear in a subsequent `rembric session list`
- **AND** the row SHALL appear in a subsequent `rembric session list --include-deleted`

#### Scenario: session delete on an unknown id exits non-zero

- **WHEN** the operator runs `rembric session delete not-a-real-ulid`
- **THEN** the command SHALL exit with a non-zero status and stderr SHALL contain a message naming the missing id

### Requirement: The dashboard MUST surface Delete + Undelete actions per session

The list view at `/dashboard/sessions` SHALL render an inline `<form action="/dashboard/sessions/<id>/delete" method="post">` per active row with a CSRF input and a `class="warn"` `Delete` button. The handler SHALL call `softDelete(id, {adminBypass: true})` and redirect to `/dashboard/sessions?deleted=<id>`. The list view SHALL render `?deleted=<id>` as a `flash success` containing an inline `Undelete` action.

The list view SHALL accept `?include_deleted=1` and render soft-deleted rows in a separate `<h2>Deleted</h2>` section beneath the Active table, mirroring how `/dashboard/projects` renders Archived projects.

The detail view at `/dashboard/sessions/:id` SHALL render whether the row is soft-deleted (regardless of the query parameter). When soft-deleted, the page SHALL display a `flash error` reading "This session is deleted." and the action area SHALL show an `Undelete` button (CSRF-protected) at `POST /dashboard/sessions/<id>/undelete` instead of `Delete`.

#### Scenario: Operator soft-deletes a session from the list view

- **GIVEN** an authenticated admin session and an active Rembric session row with id `<S>`
- **WHEN** the operator submits the row's Delete form
- **THEN** the response SHALL be a 302 redirect to `/dashboard/sessions?deleted=<S>`
- **AND** the row SHALL NOT appear in a subsequent GET of `/dashboard/sessions`
- **AND** the row SHALL appear in a subsequent GET of `/dashboard/sessions?include_deleted=1`

#### Scenario: Operator undeletes from the detail view

- **GIVEN** a soft-deleted session at `/dashboard/sessions/<S>` and an authenticated admin
- **WHEN** the operator submits the Undelete form
- **THEN** the response SHALL be a 302 redirect to `/dashboard/sessions`
- **AND** the row SHALL re-appear in the default list

#### Scenario: Delete without CSRF is rejected

- **GIVEN** an authenticated admin session
- **WHEN** a POST to `/dashboard/sessions/<S>/delete` arrives without the `csrf` field
- **THEN** the response SHALL be `403` with the standard `csrf_invalid` body

### Requirement: Session-tool handlers MUST honor the documented scope-resolution precedence

Every MCP tool handler under `src/mcp/sessions-tools.ts` that needs to resolve the effective project (`memory.context`, `memory.timeline`, `memory.stats`, `memory.doctor`, `memory.save_prompt`, `memory.session_end`, `memory.session_summary`, `memory.capture_passive`) SHALL resolve scope by consulting, in this order:

1. `ctx.project` from the request context, populated when the connection is path-scoped (`/mcp/<slug>`).
2. The `SessionRouter` entry for `(tokenId, mcpSessionId)`, populated by a prior `project.use` call or by roots-based discovery, when the connection is path-less (`ctx.requestedSlug === null`).
3. Global scope, when neither source resolves a project.

A handler that resolves scope using only `ctx.project` and falls through directly to global scope SHALL be considered to be in violation of this requirement.

#### Scenario: Path-less connection with router pin returns project scope

- **GIVEN** a token connected to `/mcp` (path-less)
- **AND** an agent has called `project.use({slug: 'foo', create: true})` successfully
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.context`
- **THEN** the response SHALL include `scope: "project:<foo.id>"` and the project's recent memories

#### Scenario: Path-less connection with no router entry returns global scope

- **GIVEN** a token connected to `/mcp` (path-less)
- **AND** no `project.use` call has been made on this MCP session
- **AND** no roots-based discovery has populated the router
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.context`
- **THEN** the response SHALL include `scope: "global"` and only global-scope memories

#### Scenario: Path-scoped connection ignores router fallback

- **GIVEN** a token connected to `/mcp/bar` where project `bar` does not exist
- **AND** the router has a leftover entry pointing to project `foo` from a previous session reusing the same `(tokenId, mcpSessionId)` keys
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.context`
- **THEN** the response SHALL include `scope: "global"` (the path-scoped intent overrides the stale router entry)
- **AND** the response SHALL NOT leak `foo`'s memories

#### Scenario: Path-scoped connection to existing project returns that project's scope

- **GIVEN** a token connected to `/mcp/baz` where project `baz` exists
- **AND** auth has resolved `ctx.project` to the `baz` project
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.context`
- **THEN** the response SHALL include `scope: "project:<baz.id>"` regardless of any router state

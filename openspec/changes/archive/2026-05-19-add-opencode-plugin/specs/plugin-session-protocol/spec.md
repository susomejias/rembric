## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Sessions MUST converge on a non-null summary when the agent cooperates OR the transcript is reachable

Every closed session in the dashboard SHALL display a non-null `summary` whenever ANY of the following held during its lifetime:

- The agent called `memory.session_summary({summary, title?})` at any point.
- The session compacted (Claude Code only) and the model produced a compact summary the post-compact instruction injection could refer to.
- The session reached `SessionEnd` (Claude Code) or successive `Stop` invocations (Codex) with a readable `transcript_path` containing at least one assistant turn.
- The session ran under Hermes Agent (`on_session_end(messages)` with non-empty messages).
- The session ran under opencode AND the agent called `memory.session_summary({summary, title?})` voluntarily (cooperating-agent path). opencode has no `SessionEnd`-equivalent or `Stop`-equivalent event the plugin can hook; non-cooperating opencode sessions therefore stay in `status='active'` until `abandonStale` flips them to `'abandoned'`. Summary convergence for non-cooperating opencode agents is OUT of scope — the dashboard surfaces these as "no summary captured" without crashing, same as the contrary cases enumerated below.

A session SHALL be considered to have "converged on a summary" if its `sessions.summary` column is non-null. Coverage in the contrary case (transcript file missing, hook scripts never fired, agent ignored every instruction, Hermes messages list empty, opencode agent never called `memory.session_summary`) is OUT of scope — these are degenerate states the dashboard surfaces as "no summary captured" without crashing.

#### Scenario: Claude Code short session with cooperating agent

- **GIVEN** a Claude Code session of N user prompts (N ≥ 1, no compact)
- **AND** the agent called `memory.session_summary({summary, title})` at any point before stop
- **WHEN** the user closes the session and `SessionEnd` fires
- **THEN** `sessions.summary` SHALL be the model-authored content (preserved because `final:true` blocks the bash overwrite)
- **AND** `sessions.title` SHALL be the model-authored title
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL be `'ended'`

#### Scenario: Claude Code short session with non-cooperating agent

- **GIVEN** a Claude Code session of N user prompts (N ≥ 1, no compact)
- **AND** the agent never called `memory.session_summary`
- **WHEN** the user closes the session and `SessionEnd` fires with a non-empty `transcript_path` JSONL
- **THEN** `sessions.summary` SHALL be the bash fallback's formatted transcript (oldest-first, role: content, truncated to 19500 chars)
- **AND** `sessions.title` SHALL be derived from the first non-empty assistant message in the transcript, truncated to 100 chars
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL be `'ended'`

#### Scenario: Codex short session captures summary via per-turn Stop

- **GIVEN** a Codex session of N turns (N ≥ 1, no compact)
- **AND** every `Stop` hook fired and posted `/summary` with the running transcript
- **WHEN** the user closes the Codex CLI
- **THEN** `sessions.summary` SHALL contain the most recent transcript (from the final `Stop` of the session)
- **AND** `sessions.title` SHALL be derived from the first non-empty assistant message
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL be `'active'` until `abandonStale` flips it to `'abandoned'` (Codex has no SessionEnd signal — this is the expected steady state)

#### Scenario: Hermes short session

- **GIVEN** a Hermes session of N turns (N ≥ 1, no compress)
- **WHEN** the user exits and `on_session_end(messages)` fires
- **THEN** the provider SHALL POST `/end {summary: _format_transcript(messages), title, final:false}`
- **AND** `sessions.summary` SHALL be non-null
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL be `'ended'`

#### Scenario: opencode short session with cooperating agent

- **GIVEN** an opencode session of N user prompts (N ≥ 1, no compact)
- **AND** the agent called `memory.session_summary({summary, title})` via MCP at any point
- **WHEN** the session ends (user closes opencode, switches projects, or `experimental.session.compacting` fires triggering the compacted-agent reminder path)
- **THEN** `sessions.summary` SHALL be the model-authored content
- **AND** `sessions.title` SHALL be the model-authored title
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL transition to `'ended'` only via the `memory.session_summary` write (the opencode plugin never POSTs `/end`)

#### Scenario: opencode short session with non-cooperating agent

- **GIVEN** an opencode session of N user prompts (N ≥ 1, no compact)
- **AND** the agent never called `memory.session_summary`
- **WHEN** the user closes opencode without compacting
- **THEN** `sessions.summary` SHALL remain `NULL` (no bash transcript fallback exists for opencode — its plugin is JS, not shell, and the platform exposes no `transcript_path`)
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL be `'active'` until `abandonStale` flips it to `'abandoned'`
- **AND** the dashboard SHALL surface the session as "no summary captured" without crashing

#### Scenario: opencode session survives compaction with cooperating agent

- **GIVEN** an opencode session approaching the context window limit
- **WHEN** `experimental.session.compacting` fires
- **THEN** the plugin appends the recall-context block AND the "FIRST ACTION REQUIRED: call memory.session_summary" reminder to `output.context`
- **AND** the next agent (post-compaction) reads that reminder and calls `memory.session_summary({summary: <compacted summary content>, title})`
- **AND** the resulting row in `sessions` has the compacted summary as `summary` and a non-null `title`

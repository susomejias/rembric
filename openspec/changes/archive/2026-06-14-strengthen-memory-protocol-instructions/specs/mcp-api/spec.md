## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The MCP `initialize` response MUST ship a protocol-teaching `instructions` block

When the MCP server is constructed, its `instructions` field SHALL be populated with a scope-aware string that teaches the agent when to call each tool. The string SHALL be 1000 characters or fewer in both variants. This cap is a self-imposed token budget, NOT a client or protocol limit: the MCP specification defines `InitializeResult.instructions` as an optional free-form string with no maximum length or truncation rule, and no consuming client enforces one.

The instructions SHALL be organized as directive, proactively-phrased guidance citing the relevant tools by name, and SHALL include all of:

1. **A proactive save flow** — directing the agent to call `memory.save` the moment something noteworthy happens (bug fix · decision · discovery · config change · pattern · preference) rather than batching to session end, and naming the `topic_key` supersede path and the `candidates[]` → `memory.judge` conflict-resolution path. Mechanical detail (error codes, scope semantics) MAY be deferred to the tool's own `description`.
2. **A recall flow** — directing the agent that when starting or resuming work, after a `/compact` event, or when asked "what did we do", it SHALL call `memory.context` (or `memory.search` for keyword lookup) BEFORE acting, but ONLY when it lacks the prior detail it needs. The phrasing SHALL keep recall on-demand — it MUST NOT direct an unconditional `memory.context` load at session start.
3. **A session-close flow** — directing the agent to call `memory.session_summary({title, summary})`. The trigger SHALL be bound to ending a turn in which real work happened — phrased so the agent saves before ending any working turn, and SHALL NOT be evadable by avoiding the literal word "done". The flow SHALL describe the title constraint (≤100 chars, descriptive of what was actually worked on — NOT the cwd, NOT generic), the summary structure (Goal · Discoveries · Accomplished · Next Steps · Files), AND the summary length cap (≤2000 chars). The cap MUST be present inline so the agent budgets for it on the first attempt; this is verified by the same length test that enforces the 1000-character ceiling.
4. **The update-guidance pointer** — a short clause naming `memory.about` as the tool to call when the operator asks how to update or upgrade Rembric (server or plugins).

#### Scenario: An MCP client connects on `/mcp/<slug>`

- **WHEN** the `initialize` handshake completes against `/mcp/my-project`
- **THEN** the `InitializeResult.instructions` SHALL contain references to `memory.save`, `memory.search`, `memory.session_summary`, AND `memory.context` plus a note indicating the connection is project-scoped to `'my-project'` and that `scope='global'` will be rejected
- **AND** the instructions SHALL contain the substring `memory.session_summary` and the substring `title` and a reference to "before" (referring to before ending a working turn)
- **AND** the instructions SHALL contain the substring `2000` (the summary length cap)
- **AND** the instructions SHALL contain the substring `memory.context` (the recall flow)
- **AND** the instructions SHALL contain the substring `memory.about` (the update-guidance pointer)

#### Scenario: The session-summary trigger is bound to ending a working turn

- **WHEN** either variant of `buildInstructions(ctx)` is built
- **THEN** the instructions SHALL phrase the `memory.session_summary` trigger as firing before ending any turn in which real work happened
- **AND** the instructions SHALL NOT bind the trigger solely to the literal phrase `before saying "done"`

#### Scenario: Recall guidance is on-demand, not unconditional-at-start

- **WHEN** either variant of `buildInstructions(ctx)` is built
- **THEN** the `memory.context` recall flow SHALL be conditioned on the agent lacking prior detail (e.g. starting/resuming work, after `/compact`, or "what did we do")
- **AND** the instructions SHALL NOT direct an unconditional `memory.context` load on every session start

#### Scenario: An MCP client connects on `/mcp` without a project

- **WHEN** the `initialize` handshake completes against `/mcp`
- **THEN** the `InitializeResult.instructions` SHALL contain the same protocol flows (the proactive save flow, the on-demand recall flow, the session-close flow with the `2000`-char cap, AND the `memory.about` update-guidance pointer) and a note indicating the connection is global-scope and that project memories require opening `/mcp/<slug>` or sending `X-Rembric-Project`

#### Scenario: Instructions length is checked at build time

- **WHEN** the test suite runs against both `/mcp` and `/mcp/<slug>` variants of `buildInstructions(ctx)`
- **THEN** both outputs SHALL be 1000 characters or fewer (the raised cap — the 2000-char summary cap mention, the recall flow, AND the memory.about pointer MUST all fit within the 1000-char budget)
- **AND** both outputs SHALL contain the substring `2000`
- **AND** both outputs SHALL contain the substring `memory.context`
- **AND** both outputs SHALL contain the substring `memory.about`

#### Scenario: A client that does not consume `instructions` connects

- **WHEN** an MCP client ignores the `instructions` field
- **THEN** every tool SHALL still function normally (the field is informational only)
- **AND** `memory.about` SHALL remain discoverable through the MCP tool manifest regardless of whether the client consumed the `instructions` pointer

#### Scenario: instructions.test.ts asserts the protocol flows are present

- **WHEN** `apps/server/src/mcp/instructions.test.ts` runs against `buildInstructions({requestedSlug: 'demo'})` and `buildInstructions({requestedSlug: null})`
- **THEN** both outputs SHALL contain the substrings `memory.save`, `memory.context`, `memory.session_summary`, AND `memory.about`
- **AND** both outputs SHALL be ≤1000 chars
- **AND** existing assertions for `memory.search`, scope notes, the `2000` cap, and the proactive (non-"done"-bound) session-summary phrasing SHALL pass

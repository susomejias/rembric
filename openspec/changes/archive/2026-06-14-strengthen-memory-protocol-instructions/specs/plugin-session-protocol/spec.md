## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The protocol nudge MUST be in `initialize.instructions` to cover all three clients uniformly

The MCP server's `initialize.instructions` string (loaded into the model's system prompt on connect) SHALL include a directive flow instructing the model to call `memory.session_summary` with `{title, summary}` at the end of every turn in which real work happened — never ending a working turn silent. The flow SHALL:

- Be present in both the path-scoped and path-less variants of `initialize.instructions`.
- Stay within the 1000-character cap enforced by `instructions.test.ts` (raised from 800; the cap is a self-imposed token budget, not a client or protocol limit).
- Be phrased proactively and SHALL NOT bind the trigger solely to the literal word "done".
- Describe the title constraint (≤100 chars, descriptive of what was worked on) and the summary structure (Goal · Discoveries · Accomplished · Next Steps · Files).

This nudge is the only mechanism that covers the case where Codex CLI cannot inject post-compact instructions and where short sessions never compact; it is likewise the only nudging surface available to in-process clients (e.g. Hermes Agent) that expose no per-turn hook. All clients ship with the same MCP server reachable, so this is the single deployment surface.

#### Scenario: Instructions string contains the protocol nudge

- **WHEN** an MCP client retrieves `initialize.instructions` from either `/mcp` or `/mcp/<slug>`
- **THEN** the string SHALL contain the substring `memory.session_summary` AND the substring `title` AND the substring `before` (referring to before ending a working turn)

#### Scenario: Instructions string respects the 1000-char cap

- **WHEN** the test suite runs `instructions.test.ts` against both variants
- **THEN** both outputs SHALL be ≤1000 characters

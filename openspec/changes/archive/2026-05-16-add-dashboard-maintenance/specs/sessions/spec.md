## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Sessions MUST be append-only

The system SHALL never physically delete a session row and SHALL never mutate the `agent`, `token_id`, `started_at`, or `project_id` of an existing session, EXCEPT through the operator-only physical-purge escape hatch defined in "Sessions MAY be physically purged when empty". Lifecycle changes are otherwise expressed exclusively by transitioning the `status` column among `active`, `ended`, and `abandoned`, by writing the `ended_at` column at most once, and by writing the `summary` and `title` columns subject to the `summary_final` / `title_final` precedence flags.

The `deleted_at` column is exempt from immutability: it SHALL transition from NULL to a timestamp (soft-delete) or from a timestamp back to NULL (undelete) any number of times. Both transitions SHALL be guarded by the cross-token rule that already protects `end` and `summarize`, unless the caller is an operator-facing surface (CLI or dashboard) that sets `adminBypass: true`.

The `id` column is set exactly once at insert time. It MAY originate from a client (via `POST /api/<slug>/sessions` or `start({id})`) or be server-minted (via `memory.session_start` without an explicit id). Once written it SHALL NOT be UPDATEd.

The `summary` and `title` columns are exempt from one-write-per-lifetime immutability: they MAY be written multiple times subject to the `final` precedence rules (a `final:true` write locks against `final:false` writes; non-final writes can overwrite each other).

#### Scenario: Code path attempts to physically delete a session

- **WHEN** any service or migration emits a `DELETE FROM agent_sessions` statement from any file OTHER than `src/services/agent-sessions.ts`
- **THEN** a CI invariant test SHALL fail and the build SHALL be rejected

#### Scenario: Code path attempts to mutate an immutable session column

- **WHEN** any service emits an `UPDATE agent_sessions SET agent = ?`, `UPDATE agent_sessions SET started_at = ?`, or `UPDATE agent_sessions SET id = ?` statement
- **THEN** a CI invariant test SHALL fail and the build SHALL be rejected

#### Scenario: Two `memory.session_end` (or `/api/.../end`) calls for the same session id

- **WHEN** `memory.session_end` (MCP) or `POST /api/<slug>/sessions/:id/end` (HTTP) is called twice on the same `(token_id, id)`
- **THEN** the second call SHALL succeed as an idempotent no-op (status already `ended`, returns the current row) and SHALL NOT mutate `ended_at`. Summary/title write attempts in the second call SHALL be honoured only if they pass the `final` precedence check.

#### Scenario: deleted_at transitions are tracked

- **WHEN** an operator soft-deletes a session and later undeletes it
- **THEN** `deleted_at` SHALL transition NULL → timestamp → NULL and SHALL be the only column (alongside `summary`/`title`) that may revisit its initial value

#### Scenario: Summary may be updated mid-session subject to final precedence

- **GIVEN** session `<S>` is `active` and `summary` has been written once with `final:false`
- **WHEN** another write lands with `final:false`
- **THEN** the second write SHALL overwrite `summary`
- **AND** `summary_final` SHALL remain `false`

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Sessions MAY be physically purged when empty

A session row SHALL be physically deletable from the `sessions` table ONLY through `AgentSessionsService.purgeEmpty({ adminBypass: true })` and ONLY when the row satisfies all of the following at the moment of deletion:

1. `status IN ('ended', 'abandoned')`.
2. `deleted_at IS NULL` (the row has not been operator-soft-deleted; soft-deleted rows are preserved as operator intent).
3. `summary IS NULL` and `title_final = false` (no human-meaningful label was ever written).
4. `ended_at IS NOT NULL AND ended_at < (now − 3_600_000)` (a 1-hour grace period after end to avoid racing with late-arriving summary writes).
5. No row exists in `memory` with `session_id = sessions.id`.
6. No row exists in `prompts` with `session_id = sessions.id`.
7. No row exists in `confirmations` with `session_id = sessions.id`.

The method SHALL run the predicate and the `DELETE` inside a single SQLite transaction. The method SHALL write a `consolidation_ops` row with `op_type = 'session_purge'`, `affected_ids` carrying the deleted ids, and a static `reasoning` string, in the same transaction.

Without `adminBypass: true`, the method SHALL throw `DomainError('forbidden', ...)` and SHALL NOT touch the database.

#### Scenario: An empty ended session older than the grace period is purged

- **GIVEN** session `S` with `status='ended'`, `deleted_at=NULL`, `summary=NULL`, `title_final=false`, `ended_at = now − 2h`, and zero referencing rows in `memory`, `prompts`, `confirmations`
- **WHEN** `AgentSessionsService.purgeEmpty({ adminBypass: true })` is called
- **THEN** the row SHALL be removed from `sessions`
- **AND** a row SHALL exist in `consolidation_ops` with `op_type='session_purge'` and `affected_ids` containing `S.id`
- **AND** the response SHALL include `S.id` in `deletedIds`

#### Scenario: A session within the grace period is preserved

- **GIVEN** session `S` matching the purge predicate except `ended_at = now − 10 minutes`
- **WHEN** `AgentSessionsService.purgeEmpty({ adminBypass: true })` is called
- **THEN** the row SHALL remain in `sessions`
- **AND** `S.id` SHALL NOT appear in the response's `deletedIds`

#### Scenario: A soft-deleted empty session is preserved

- **GIVEN** session `S` matching the purge predicate except `deleted_at` is set to a past timestamp
- **WHEN** `AgentSessionsService.purgeEmpty({ adminBypass: true })` is called
- **THEN** the row SHALL remain in `sessions` — operator soft-delete is interpreted as "do not touch this row"

#### Scenario: A non-admin caller is rejected before any read

- **WHEN** `AgentSessionsService.purgeEmpty({})` or `AgentSessionsService.purgeEmpty({ adminBypass: false })` is called
- **THEN** the method SHALL throw `DomainError('forbidden', ...)`
- **AND** SHALL NOT issue any SQL statement

#### Scenario: A session with even a single referencing memory is preserved

- **GIVEN** session `S` matching the purge predicate except one row in `memory` has `session_id = S.id`
- **WHEN** `AgentSessionsService.purgeEmpty({ adminBypass: true })` is called
- **THEN** the row SHALL remain in `sessions`
- **AND** the memory row SHALL be unaffected

### Requirement: The session purge journal is permanent

`consolidation_ops` rows written by `purgeEmpty` SHALL NOT themselves be subject to deletion. The journal preserves the audit trail of WHICH session ids existed and WHEN they were removed, even after the session rows are gone.

#### Scenario: A session purge journal row survives subsequent purges

- **GIVEN** `purgeEmpty` has run and produced a `consolidation_ops` row referencing 12 deleted session ids
- **WHEN** a subsequent `purgeEmpty` runs on a different set of session ids
- **THEN** the original `consolidation_ops` row SHALL still exist and its `affected_ids` SHALL still list the original 12 ids

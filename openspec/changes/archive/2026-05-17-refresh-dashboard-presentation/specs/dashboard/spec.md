## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The judgment-queue view MUST be served at `/dashboard/judgments`

The dashboard SHALL serve the operator-facing queue of memory-relation judgments at the URL `/dashboard/judgments`. The page SHALL list every row of `memory_relations` (status `pending`, `judged`, or `orphaned`), SHALL support filtering by status and verdict kind, and SHALL paginate results. The legacy path `/dashboard/relations` SHALL NOT respond; any request to it SHALL return the standard dashboard `404` body.

The page heading SHALL read `Rembric Judgments.` (with `Rembric` highlighted via `hl-lime`), the document `<title>` SHALL read `Judgments · Rembric`, the empty-state cell SHALL read `No judgments match this filter.`, the table column previously labelled `relation` SHALL be labelled `verdict`, and the orphan-not-found flash SHALL read `Judgment not found or already closed.`.

#### Scenario: Operator opens the judgment queue

- **WHEN** an authenticated operator navigates to `/dashboard/judgments`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return a `200` HTML response whose heading reads `Rembric Judgments.` and whose table column header for the relation kind reads `verdict`

#### Scenario: Legacy `/dashboard/relations` returns 404

- **WHEN** any authenticated request reaches `/dashboard/relations`
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond with `404 Not Found` (no redirect)

#### Scenario: Sidebar links to the new URL

- **WHEN** any authenticated dashboard page is rendered
- **THEN** the sidebar nav item labelled `JUDGMENTS` SHALL have `href="/dashboard/judgments"` and the home overview SHALL link to `/dashboard/judgments?status=pending` from the pending-judgments stat card and from the `OPEN ALL ›` row header

#### Scenario: CSRF action token uses the judgment vocabulary

- **WHEN** the operator submits the "mark this judgment as orphaned" form on the judgments page
- **THEN** the CSRF token issued by the form and the action verified by the server SHALL both be the string `judgment.orphan`

### Requirement: The dashboard login view MUST present a single canonical brand mark, headline, and client-support footer

The `/dashboard/login` page SHALL render a single brand block in the top-left of the left pane containing the transparent Rembric logo (`/dashboard/assets/logo-transparent.png`) at 56 × 56 px on desktop, 48 × 48 px at viewports ≤ 980 px, and 40 × 40 px at viewports ≤ 640 px, followed by two lines of mono text (`REMBRIC` and `SELF-HOSTED`). The main headline SHALL read `REMBRIC DASHBOARD.` with `REMBRIC` rendered via the `hl-lime` highlight pill and the trailing period rendered in `var(--lime)`. The headline `line-height` SHALL be at least `1.3` so the `hl-lime` background does not visually clip the next line.

A footer SHALL list the supported plugin clients in the following order, separated visually by lime square bullets: `CLAUDE CODE`, `CODEX CLI`, `HERMES`, `MCP CLIENTS`. The right pane SHALL contain only the admin-token form (a labelled password input + a primary submit button) and SHALL NOT contain redundant section chips or security-disclosure copy that duplicates the `/tokens` documentation.

#### Scenario: Login renders the canonical brand mark

- **WHEN** an unauthenticated request hits `/dashboard/login`
- **THEN** the response HTML SHALL contain exactly one `<img>` with `src="/dashboard/assets/logo-transparent.png"` inside an element with class `login-brand`, placed before any `<form>` element

#### Scenario: Headline is REMBRIC DASHBOARD

- **WHEN** the login page is rendered
- **THEN** the `<h1>` SHALL contain the text `REMBRIC` wrapped in a `<span class="hl-lime">` followed by the text `DASHBOARD` and a period rendered in `var(--lime)`

#### Scenario: Footer lists all three plugin clients plus generic MCP

- **WHEN** the login page is rendered at a viewport width greater than 640 px
- **THEN** the `.login-stage .clients` element SHALL contain, in order, four labelled spans `CLAUDE CODE`, `CODEX CLI`, `HERMES`, `MCP CLIENTS`

#### Scenario: Login form has no redundant chips or disclosure block

- **WHEN** the login page is rendered
- **THEN** the response HTML SHALL NOT contain the strings `§ 00 / ACCESS`, `OPERATOR DASHBOARD`, `APPEND-ONLY`, `ADMIN-SCOPED TOKENS ONLY`, `STORED IN HTTPONLY COOKIE`, or `PLAINTEXT SHOWN ONLY ONCE IN /TOKENS`

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Dashboard timestamps MUST render in the viewer's local timezone

Every timestamp surfaced by the dashboard (memories list and detail, sessions list and detail, the soft-delete banner, prompts, consolidation runs and operations, projects list, tokens list, judgments list, and the `replaces` chain on memory detail) SHALL be rendered through a single helper that emits a `<time>` element with:

- A `datetime` attribute set to the ISO-8601 UTC representation (suffix `Z`) of the underlying timestamp.
- A `data-rembric-ts` attribute marking it as a Rembric-managed timestamp.
- A visible text content that, before any client script runs, equals the UTC string `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC`.

A small inline script bundled in the dashboard layout (`<head>`) SHALL upgrade every `<time data-rembric-ts>` element in place after the document is parsed and after every HTMX content swap, replacing its `textContent` with a `Intl.DateTimeFormat`-formatted string using the browser's timezone and default locale.

The SQLite storage, the service-layer `new Date()` writes, and the MCP serialization of timestamps SHALL remain UTC; only the dashboard HTML changes.

#### Scenario: SSR renders UTC fallback

- **WHEN** the dashboard returns an HTML page containing a timestamp
- **THEN** the response body SHALL contain a `<time datetime="…Z" data-rembric-ts>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC</time>` element for that timestamp, with no JS execution required to produce the fallback text

#### Scenario: Client upgrades the visible text to local time

- **WHEN** a browser with `Intl.DateTimeFormat` support loads any dashboard page after the change
- **THEN** every `<time data-rembric-ts>` element's `textContent` SHALL be replaced with the formatted-local-time representation of its `datetime` attribute, using the browser's timezone

#### Scenario: HTMX swap re-applies the upgrade

- **WHEN** an HTMX swap injects new `<time data-rembric-ts>` elements into the page (e.g. the memories filter form's partial response)
- **THEN** the upgrader SHALL run again on the newly inserted nodes so they also display local time

#### Scenario: Null or invalid timestamp renders an em-dash

- **WHEN** a dashboard page calls the timestamp helper with `null`, `undefined`, or a value that does not parse to a valid date
- **THEN** the rendered output SHALL be the literal em-dash `—` and SHALL NOT contain a `<time>` element

#### Scenario: Dashboard layout includes the upgrader script exactly once

- **WHEN** any dashboard page is rendered through the layout shell
- **THEN** the HTML `<head>` SHALL include exactly one inline `<script>` whose responsibility is to upgrade `<time data-rembric-ts>` elements

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Sessions MUST converge on a non-null summary when the agent cooperates OR the transcript is reachable

Every closed session in the dashboard SHALL display a non-null `summary` whenever ANY of the following held during its lifetime:

- The agent called `memory.session_summary({summary, title?})` at any point.
- The session compacted (Claude Code only) and the model produced a compact summary the post-compact instruction injection could refer to.
- The session reached `SessionEnd` (Claude Code) or successive `Stop` invocations (Codex) with a readable `transcript_path` containing at least one assistant turn.
- The session ran under Hermes Agent (`on_session_end(messages)` with non-empty messages).
- The session ran under opencode and **either** the agent called `memory.session_summary({summary, title?})` voluntarily, **or** opencode's `server.instance.disposed` event fired with a non-empty per-session transcript accumulator. The opencode plugin POSTs `/api/<slug>/sessions/<id>/summary` with `final:false` for every known top-level session at dispose time, populated from the in-memory `sessionMessages` Map fed by `chat.message` and `message.updated` handlers during the session. `status` stays `'active'` until `abandonStale` flips it (the plugin never POSTs `/end`).

A session SHALL be considered to have "converged on a summary" if its `sessions.summary` column is non-null. Coverage in the contrary case (transcript file missing, hook scripts never fired, agent ignored every instruction, Hermes messages list empty, opencode hard-crashed before `server.instance.disposed` could fire) is OUT of scope — these are degenerate states the dashboard surfaces as "no summary captured" without crashing.

Plugin-side fallback writers (bash transcript dump, Hermes `_format_transcript`, opencode dispose-time flush) truncate their transcript by Unicode **code points**, while the server measures string length in **UTF-16 code units**. The HTTP length guard SHALL account for this skew so a body within a plugin's code-point cap is NEVER rejected by it (the `http-api` capability holds the authoritative endpoint contract). On the HTTP path the server SHALL **truncate, never reject by length**: any `summary` whose length exceeds `SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS` SHALL be replaced with `summary.slice(0, SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS - SUFFIX.length) + '…[truncated]'`, and any over-length `title` SHALL be hard-cut to `TITLE_MAX_LENGTH`, before calling the service. Convergence is therefore on a row whose stored `summary` is bounded by `SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS` regardless of what the fallback writer sent — INCLUDING transcripts rich in emoji or other non-BMP characters, which previously could trip an over-strict wire cap (a `summary` at the plugin's code-point cap measuring >cap UTF-16 units) and leave the session with NO summary at all. Historical specs used literal numbers (`19500`, then `2000`, then `20000`) for derived or previous caps; this spec references the server cap (`SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS`) abstractly so it does not drift when the cap changes.

#### Scenario: Claude Code short session with cooperating agent

- **GIVEN** a Claude Code session of N user prompts (N ≥ 1, no compact)
- **AND** the agent called `memory.session_summary({summary, title})` at any point before stop with `summary.length <= SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS`
- **WHEN** the user closes the session and `SessionEnd` fires
- **THEN** `sessions.summary` SHALL be the model-authored content (preserved because `final:true` blocks the bash overwrite)
- **AND** `sessions.title` SHALL be the model-authored title
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL be `'ended'`

#### Scenario: Claude Code short session with non-cooperating agent

- **GIVEN** a Claude Code session of N user prompts (N ≥ 1, no compact)
- **AND** the agent never called `memory.session_summary`
- **WHEN** the user closes the session and `SessionEnd` fires with a non-empty `transcript_path` JSONL
- **THEN** `sessions.summary` SHALL be the bash fallback's formatted transcript (oldest-first, role: content) truncated server-side to at most `SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS` chars, with the suffix `…[truncated]` when truncation fired
- **AND** `sessions.title` SHALL be derived from the first non-empty assistant message in the transcript, truncated to 100 chars
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL be `'ended'`

#### Scenario: Codex short session captures summary via per-turn Stop

- **GIVEN** a Codex session of N turns (N ≥ 1, no compact)
- **AND** every `Stop` hook fired and posted `/summary` with the running transcript
- **WHEN** the user closes the Codex CLI
- **THEN** `sessions.summary` SHALL contain the most recent transcript (from the final `Stop` of the session), truncated server-side to at most `SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS` when the wire body exceeded the cap
- **AND** `sessions.title` SHALL be derived from the first non-empty assistant message
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL be `'active'` until `abandonStale` flips it to `'abandoned'` (Codex has no SessionEnd signal — this is the expected steady state)

#### Scenario: Hermes short session

- **GIVEN** a Hermes session of N turns (N ≥ 1, no compress)
- **WHEN** the user exits and `on_session_end(messages)` fires
- **THEN** the provider SHALL POST `/end {summary: _format_transcript(messages), title, final:false}` whose `summary` is bounded client-side by `_SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS` (a wire upper bound, not the effective cap)
- **AND** the server SHALL truncate any body exceeding `SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS` before storing
- **AND** `sessions.summary` SHALL be non-null and of length ≤ `SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS`
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL be `'ended'`

#### Scenario: Hermes emoji-rich transcript still converges (no UTF-16 wire-cap rejection)

- **GIVEN** a Hermes session whose per-turn `sync_turn` transcript contains emoji or other non-BMP characters and whose code-point length is at or near the plugin's client-side truncation cap
- **WHEN** the plugin POSTs `/sessions/<id>/summary` and the body's UTF-16 `.length` exceeds the plugin's code-point cap
- **THEN** the server SHALL accept and truncate the body (200 OK), NOT reject it with `400 invalid_input`
- **AND** `sessions.summary` SHALL be non-null (the session converges) — this is the behaviour change vs. the prior over-strict wire cap that left such sessions empty

#### Scenario: opencode short session with cooperating agent

- **GIVEN** an opencode session of N user prompts (N ≥ 1, no compact)
- **AND** the agent called `memory.session_summary({summary, title})` via MCP at any point (sets `summary_final=true` server-side)
- **WHEN** the user closes opencode (firing `server.instance.disposed`)
- **THEN** the plugin's dispose handler POSTs `/sessions/<id>/summary` with the accumulated transcript and `final:false`
- **AND** the server applies the precedence rule and DOES NOT overwrite the existing summary (because `summary_final=true`)
- **AND** `sessions.summary` SHALL remain the model-authored content
- **AND** `sessions.title` SHALL remain the model-authored title
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL transition to `'ended'` only if the cooperating `memory.session_summary` call routed through the MCP server's terminating path; otherwise stays `'active'` until `abandonStale` flips it

#### Scenario: opencode short session with non-cooperating agent

- **GIVEN** an opencode session of N user prompts (N ≥ 1, no compact)
- **AND** the agent never called `memory.session_summary`
- **WHEN** the user closes opencode (firing `server.instance.disposed`)
- **THEN** the plugin's dispose handler POSTs `/sessions/<id>/summary` for every known session with body `{summary: <role-prefixed transcript bounded by the plugin's client-side wire upper bound>, title?: <first user text truncated to 100 chars>, final: false}`
- **AND** the server SHALL truncate `summary` to `SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS` chars with the suffix `…[truncated]` when the wire body exceeded the cap
- **AND** `sessions.summary` SHALL be the accumulated (possibly server-truncated) transcript (NOT `NULL` — this is the key behaviour change vs the pre-0.8.0 plugin)
- **AND** `sessions.title` SHALL be the derived title when the accumulator had at least one user entry; OMITTED from the body otherwise (server leaves the placeholder `basename(cwd) · HH:MM UTC` in place)
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL be `'active'` until `abandonStale` flips it to `'abandoned'`
- **AND** the dashboard surfaces the session row with the (possibly truncated) transcript visible immediately after close

#### Scenario: opencode hard-crash before dispose fires

- **GIVEN** opencode is killed via SIGKILL (or OS-level crash) before `server.instance.disposed` can fire
- **WHEN** the operator opens the dashboard
- **THEN** the session row's `summary` SHALL be `NULL` (no fallback exists for this scenario — same risk Claude/Codex hooks carry)
- **AND** `sessions.status` SHALL be `'active'` until `abandonStale` flips it
- **AND** the dashboard surfaces the session as "no summary captured" without crashing

#### Scenario: opencode session survives compaction with cooperating agent

- **GIVEN** an opencode session approaching the context window limit
- **WHEN** `experimental.session.compacting` fires
- **THEN** the plugin appends the recall-context block AND the "FIRST ACTION REQUIRED: call memory.session_summary" reminder to `output.context`
- **AND** the next agent (post-compaction) reads that reminder and calls `memory.session_summary({summary: <compacted summary content>, title})` with `summary.length <= SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS`
- **AND** the resulting row in `sessions` has the compacted summary as `summary` and a non-null `title`

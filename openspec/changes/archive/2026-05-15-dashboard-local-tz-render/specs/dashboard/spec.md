## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Dashboard timestamps MUST render in the viewer's local timezone

Every timestamp surfaced by the dashboard (memories list and detail, sessions list and detail, the soft-delete banner, prompts, consolidation runs and operations, projects list, tokens list, relations list, and the `replaces` chain on memory detail) SHALL be rendered through a single helper that emits a `<time>` element with:

- A `datetime` attribute set to the ISO-8601 UTC representation (suffix `Z`) of the underlying timestamp.
- A `data-rembric-ts` attribute marking it as a Rembric-managed timestamp.
- A visible text content that, before any client script runs, equals the UTC string `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC`.

A small inline script bundled in the dashboard layout (`<head>`) SHALL upgrade every `<time data-rembric-ts>` element in place after the document is parsed and after every HTMX content swap, replacing its `textContent` with a `Intl.DateTimeFormat`-formatted string using the browser's timezone and default locale.

The SQLite storage, the service-layer `new Date()` writes, and the MCP serialization of timestamps SHALL remain UTC; only the dashboard HTML changes.

#### Scenario: SSR renders UTC fallback

- **WHEN** the dashboard returns an HTML page containing a timestamp
- **THEN** the response body SHALL contain a `<time datetime="…Z" data-rembric-ts>YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC</time>` element for that timestamp, with no JS execution required to produce the fallback text

#### Scenario: Client upgrades the visible text to local time

- **WHEN** a browser with `Intl.DateTimeFormat` support loads any dashboard page after the change
- **THEN** every `<time data-rembric-ts>` element's `textContent` SHALL be replaced with the formatted-local-time representation of its `datetime` attribute, using the browser's timezone

#### Scenario: HTMX swap re-applies the upgrade

- **WHEN** an HTMX swap injects new `<time data-rembric-ts>` elements into the page (e.g. the memories filter form's partial response)
- **THEN** the upgrader SHALL run again on the newly inserted nodes so they also display local time

#### Scenario: Null or invalid timestamp renders an em-dash

- **WHEN** a dashboard page calls the timestamp helper with `null`, `undefined`, or a value that does not parse to a valid date
- **THEN** the rendered output SHALL be the literal em-dash `—` and SHALL NOT contain a `<time>` element

#### Scenario: Dashboard layout includes the upgrader script exactly once

- **WHEN** any dashboard page is rendered through the layout shell
- **THEN** the HTML `<head>` SHALL include exactly one inline `<script>` whose responsibility is to upgrade `<time data-rembric-ts>` elements

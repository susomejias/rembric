## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Memories MAY be physically purged when archived and disconnected

A row SHALL be physically deletable from the `memory` table ONLY through `MemoryService.purgeDisconnectedArchived({ adminBypass: true })` and ONLY when the row satisfies all of the following at the moment of deletion:

1. `status = 'archived'`.
2. No row exists in the derived `memory_replaces` table with this row's id as `predecessor_id`. (No supersession chain reaches this row.) `memory_replaces` is a reverse-edge index over `memory.replaces`, kept in sync by triggers — this condition is behaviorally identical to "no other row in `memory` has this row's id in its `replaces` JSON array," just checked against the indexed table instead of a full-table `json_each` scan.
3. No row in `consolidation_ops` references this row's id via its `affected_ids` JSON array.
4. No row in `consolidation_ops` references this row's id via its `created_id` column.
5. No row in `memory_relations` references this row's id via `source_id` or `target_id`.
6. No row in `confirmations` references this row's id via `memory_id`.

The method SHALL delete the matching rows from `memory_vec`, `memory_fts`, and `memory` inside a single SQLite transaction, in that order (drop derived data first, base data last, so derived-table syncs do not observe a half-deleted base row). The `memory_replaces_ad` trigger removes the deleted row's own entries from `memory_replaces` (both as predecessor and as successor) as part of the same `DELETE FROM memory` statement — no separate cleanup step is needed. The method SHALL write a `consolidation_ops` row with `op_type = 'archived_memory_purge'`, `affected_ids` carrying the deleted memory ids, and a static `reasoning` string, in the same transaction.

Without `adminBypass: true`, the method SHALL throw `DomainError('forbidden', ...)` and SHALL NOT touch the database.

#### Scenario: A fully-disconnected archived memory is purged

- **GIVEN** memory `M` with `status='archived'`, not referenced by any other `memory.replaces`, any `consolidation_ops.affected_ids` or `created_id`, any `memory_relations.source_id` or `target_id`, or any `confirmations.memory_id`
- **WHEN** `MemoryService.purgeDisconnectedArchived({ adminBypass: true })` is called
- **THEN** the row SHALL be removed from `memory`
- **AND** any matching row in `memory_vec` SHALL be removed
- **AND** any matching row in `memory_fts` SHALL be removed
- **AND** a row SHALL exist in `consolidation_ops` with `op_type='archived_memory_purge'` and `affected_ids` containing `M.id`
- **AND** the response SHALL include `M.id` in `deletedIds`

#### Scenario: An archived memory referenced by a later replaces is preserved

- **GIVEN** memory `M` with `status='archived'` and memory `N` with `replaces` containing `M.id`
- **WHEN** `MemoryService.purgeDisconnectedArchived({ adminBypass: true })` is called
- **THEN** `M` SHALL remain in `memory` — the supersession chain reaches it
- **AND** `M.id` SHALL NOT appear in the response's `deletedIds`

#### Scenario: An archived memory referenced by a consolidation op is preserved

- **GIVEN** memory `M` with `status='archived'` and a `consolidation_ops` row whose `affected_ids` contains `M.id`
- **WHEN** `MemoryService.purgeDisconnectedArchived({ adminBypass: true })` is called
- **THEN** `M` SHALL remain in `memory` — the consolidation journal still references it
- **AND** the consolidation op SHALL remain reversible

#### Scenario: An archived memory referenced by a memory_relations row is preserved

- **GIVEN** memory `M` with `status='archived'` and a `memory_relations` row whose `source_id` or `target_id` equals `M.id`
- **WHEN** `MemoryService.purgeDisconnectedArchived({ adminBypass: true })` is called
- **THEN** `M` SHALL remain in `memory`

#### Scenario: An archived memory with a surviving confirmation is preserved

- **GIVEN** memory `M` with `status='archived'` and at least one `confirmations` row whose `memory_id = M.id`
- **WHEN** `MemoryService.purgeDisconnectedArchived({ adminBypass: true })` is called
- **THEN** `M` SHALL remain in `memory` — confirmation history is audit-relevant

#### Scenario: An active or superseded memory is never purged

- **GIVEN** memory `M` with `status IN ('active', 'superseded')`, even if all other "disconnected" conditions hold
- **WHEN** `MemoryService.purgeDisconnectedArchived({ adminBypass: true })` is called
- **THEN** `M` SHALL remain in `memory` — only archived rows are eligible

#### Scenario: A non-admin caller is rejected before any read

- **WHEN** `MemoryService.purgeDisconnectedArchived({})` or `MemoryService.purgeDisconnectedArchived({ adminBypass: false })` is called
- **THEN** the method SHALL throw `DomainError('forbidden', ...)`
- **AND** SHALL NOT issue any SQL statement

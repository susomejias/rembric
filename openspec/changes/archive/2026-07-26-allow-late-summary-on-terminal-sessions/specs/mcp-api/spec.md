## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The MCP server MUST expose three session-lifecycle tools

The `/mcp` and `/mcp/<slug>` endpoints SHALL register the tools `memory.session_start`, `memory.session_end`, and `memory.session_summary` with the following contracts. The tools are split by responsibility: `memory.session_start` opens a session, `memory.session_summary` writes summary/title without transitioning, `memory.session_end` is the sole state transition. This is a behaviour change from the prior contract where `memory.session_summary` ended the session as a side effect.

`memory.session_summary` SHALL validate `summary` against the single canonical cap exported from `apps/server/src/services/agent-sessions.ts` (`SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS`, currently `10000`). The MCP zod schema SHALL be `summary: z.string().min(1).max(SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS)` so overflow is rejected at the transport boundary with `invalid_input` before the tool body runs. The rejected agent SHALL receive an error whose message contains the decimal string of `SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS` so it can retry with a tighter body on the first attempt.

`memory.session_summary` and `memory.session_end` SHALL NOT reject a call because the resolved row is in a terminal state. Both SHALL apply the summary/title writes subject to the `final` precedence rules regardless of `status`, and neither SHALL mutate `status`, `ended_at` or `last_activity_at` on a terminal row — see the `sessions` capability, "Terminal session rows MUST accept late summary and title writes". `session_already_ended` SHALL NOT be a possible error code for either tool. This matters because the plugin's `PreCompact`, `SessionStart:compact` and `Stop` nudges instruct the agent to call `memory.session_summary`, and the stale-active retirement sweep can have flipped the row to `abandoned` (the documented steady state for two of the four clients) before the agent gets there.

Session resolution is unchanged and SHALL remain status-aware where it already is: `memory.session_summary` resolves its target from an explicit `sessionId`, else the transport's `SessionRouter` entry, else the unambiguous `active` session for the caller's `(token_id, project_id)`. The third source SHALL continue to consider only `active` rows, so an agent that supplies neither an explicit id nor a router-mapped session SHALL receive `session_not_found` rather than having its write attached to a closed session picked by recency.

#### Scenario: `memory.session_start` opens a new session

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_start` with `{ agent?: string, description?: string }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL insert a `sessions` row with `status = 'active'`, `started_at = now`, the provided `agent` (or `'unknown'`), `token_id` from the request context, `project_id` from the request scope, and a placeholder `title` of the form `basename(cwd) · HH:MM UTC` with `title_final = false`; **AND** the response SHALL be `{ sessionId, scope, startedAt, title }`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_end` ends a session without summary

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_end` with `{ sessionId: string }` for an active session
- **THEN** the server SHALL set `status = 'ended'` and `ended_at = now` on that row, leave `summary` and `title` unchanged, and SHALL return `{ ok: true, endedAt }`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_end` is idempotent on already-ended sessions

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_end` on a row whose `status` is already `'ended'`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ ok: true, endedAt }` with the existing `ended_at` and SHALL NOT mutate the row

#### Scenario: `memory.session_end` is idempotent on abandoned sessions

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_end` on a row whose `status` is `'abandoned'` with `ended_at = E`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ ok: true, endedAt: E }`, SHALL leave `status = 'abandoned'` and `ended_at = E` untouched, and SHALL NOT return `session_already_ended`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` writes summary and title without ending the session

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_summary` with `{ sessionId?: string, summary: string, title?: string }` and `summary.length <= SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS`
- **THEN** the server SHALL resolve `sessionId` from the active MCP transport mapping when omitted, write `summary` with `summary_final = true`, write `title` (when provided, after validating length ≤100) with `title_final = true`, leave `status`/`ended_at` unchanged, and return `{ ok: true, sessionId, summary, title, summaryFinal: true, titleFinal: <true|false> }`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` succeeds on a session the sweep already abandoned

- **GIVEN** the agent's session was flipped to `status = 'abandoned'` with `ended_at = E` and `last_activity_at = L` by stale-active retirement while the conversation was still open, and the agent knows its `sessionId` (the plugin's nudge injects it)
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.session_summary({ sessionId, summary, title })`
- **THEN** the call SHALL succeed and return `{ ok: true, sessionId, summary, title, summaryFinal: true, … }`
- **AND** the row SHALL retain `status = 'abandoned'`, `ended_at = E` and `last_activity_at = L`
- **AND** the call SHALL NOT return `session_already_ended`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` succeeds on an ended session

- **GIVEN** a row whose `status = 'ended'` with `ended_at = E`
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.session_summary({ sessionId, summary })`
- **THEN** the call SHALL succeed with `summaryFinal: true`, and `status`/`ended_at` SHALL be unchanged

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` with no resolvable session still reports `session_not_found`

- **GIVEN** the agent passes no explicit `sessionId`, the transport has no `SessionRouter` entry, and the only candidate row for its `(token_id, project_id)` is `abandoned`
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.session_summary({ summary })`
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `session_not_found` (NOT `session_already_ended`, and NOT silently attached to the abandoned row)

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` may be called multiple times; the latest call wins

- **GIVEN** a session whose `summary_final = true` from a prior `memory.session_summary({summary: "A"})` call
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.session_summary({summary: "B"})` again
- **THEN** `summary` SHALL be replaced with "B" (last-final-wins among final writes)

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` rejects empty summary

- **WHEN** the agent submits `summary: ""` or whitespace-only
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `invalid_input`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` rejects title over 100 chars

- **WHEN** the agent submits `title: "A".repeat(101)`
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `invalid_input`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` rejects summary over `SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS`

- **WHEN** the agent submits `summary: "A".repeat(SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS + 1)` (one char over the cap)
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected at the zod boundary with code `invalid_input`
- **AND** the error message SHALL contain the decimal string of `SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS` so the agent can deduce the cap and retry with a tighter body on the first attempt
- **AND** the session row SHALL NOT be mutated (no partial write, `summary_final` unchanged)

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` accepts summary of exactly `SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS`

- **WHEN** the agent submits `summary: "A".repeat(SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS)`
- **THEN** the call SHALL succeed and the row SHALL have `summary` of length `SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS` with `summary_final = true`

#### Scenario: A session-lifecycle tool targets a session owned by a different token

- **WHEN** any of the three tools is called with a `sessionId` whose `token_id` does not match the caller's token
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `session_not_found` (never `forbidden`, to avoid information disclosure)

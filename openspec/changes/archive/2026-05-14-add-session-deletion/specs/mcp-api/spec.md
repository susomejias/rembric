## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Session-lifecycle MCP tools MUST reject soft-deleted sessions

`memory.session_end` and `memory.session_summary` SHALL resolve the target row before performing any state transition. When the resolved row has `deleted_at IS NOT NULL`, the call SHALL be rejected with a structured MCP error containing `code: 'session_deleted'` and a message naming the deleted-at timestamp. No state mutation SHALL be performed. The cross-token check that already protects these calls SHALL continue to run first; only when the cross-token check passes does the `session_deleted` gate apply.

`memory.session_start` is unaffected — every call opens a brand-new session row and never touches a deleted one.

#### Scenario: memory.session_end targets a soft-deleted session

- **GIVEN** a Rembric session `<S>` whose `deleted_at` is non-null, owned by token `<T>`
- **WHEN** an MCP client authenticated as `<T>` calls `memory.session_end` with `sessionId = <S>`
- **THEN** the response SHALL be an MCP error containing `code: 'session_deleted'` and a message naming the deleted-at timestamp
- **AND** no column on the row SHALL be mutated

#### Scenario: memory.session_summary targets a soft-deleted session

- **GIVEN** a Rembric session `<S>` whose `deleted_at` is non-null, owned by token `<T>`
- **WHEN** an MCP client authenticated as `<T>` calls `memory.session_summary` with `sessionId = <S>` and a non-empty summary
- **THEN** the response SHALL be an MCP error containing `code: 'session_deleted'`
- **AND** the row's `summary` column SHALL remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Cross-token check still runs before the deleted gate

- **GIVEN** a Rembric session `<S>` owned by token `<T1>`, soft-deleted
- **WHEN** an MCP client authenticated as a different token `<T2>` calls `memory.session_end` on `<S>`
- **THEN** the response SHALL be an MCP error with the existing cross-token `forbidden` code, NOT `session_deleted`

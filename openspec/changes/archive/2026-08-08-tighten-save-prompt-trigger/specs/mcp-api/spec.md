## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The MCP server MUST expose `memory.save_prompt` with optional metadata and refine semantics

The `/mcp` and `/mcp/<slug>` endpoints SHALL register `memory.save_prompt` for persisting curated user prompts. Input schema:

- `content: string` (required, non-empty after trim).
- `title: string` (required, ≤100 chars).
- `tags?: string[]` (optional; each element is a non-empty string).
- `replaces?: string` (optional; ULID of a predecessor prompt in the same scope).
- `sessionId?: string` (optional; when provided, takes precedence over the session-attach helper's own resolution — see the `sessionId` reinforcement requirement below).

Standard behaviour: the server SHALL insert a new row into `prompts` with `content`, `title`, `tags`, the resolved `session_id` (the caller's explicit `sessionId` when provided, else the existing session-attach helper), the active scope's `project_id`, and `agent` copied from the token name. The row SHALL be created with `deleted_at = NULL`, `replaces = NULL`.

Refine behaviour: when `replaces` is provided, the server SHALL run an atomic SQLite transaction that:

1. Loads the predecessor row by id.
2. Rejects with `prompt_not_found` if no row exists.
3. Rejects with `prompt_scope_mismatch` if the predecessor's `project_id` does not match the active scope's `project_id`.
4. Rejects with `prompt_already_deleted` if the predecessor's `deleted_at IS NOT NULL`.
5. Sets the predecessor's `deleted_at = now()`.
6. Inserts the new prompt row with `replaces = [<predecessorId>]`.
7. Returns `{ ok: true, id: <newId>, createdAt: <ts>, replaces: [<predecessorId>] }`.

On `replaces=null`/unset, the response SHALL be `{ ok: true, id: <newId>, createdAt: <ts> }`.

The tool's description SHALL constrain WHEN to call it, not only what to pass. The prompt library is curated, so the description SHALL state that the tool is for a prompt worth REUSING, SHALL forbid calling it routinely or once per session as a matter of course, SHALL require either an explicit request from the user or text that is plainly a reusable artifact, and SHALL redirect the two adjacent intents elsewhere (`memory.save` for decisions/fixes/discoveries, `memory.session_summary` for what happened in a session).

The description SHALL additionally rule out the specific false positive that a stated goal is sufficient. A session's first message states a goal almost by definition, so a trigger phrased as "the user states a goal or constraint worth remembering" is satisfied once per session by construction — which is how the tool came to fire on nearly every opening turn while every other surface behaved correctly. The nudge cadence is not the cause and SHALL NOT change: the sessionId reminder that names this tool on turn 1 is required behaviour (see the plugin-session-protocol capability), and it only names the tool — the description is what makes calling it look correct.

#### Scenario: `memory.save_prompt` persists optional title and tags

- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.save_prompt({ content: "ship the auth refactor by Friday", title: "auth refactor deadline", tags: ["deadline", "auth"] })`
- **THEN** the persisted row SHALL have `title = "auth refactor deadline"` and `tags = '["deadline","auth"]'` (JSON encoded)
- **AND** the row SHALL be indexed in `prompts_fts` with both `content` and the flattened `tags` string

#### Scenario: `memory.save_prompt` rejects title over 100 chars

- **WHEN** the agent submits `title: "A".repeat(101)`
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `invalid_input`

#### Scenario: `memory.save_prompt` refine soft-deletes the predecessor atomically

- **GIVEN** an active prompt `P1` in project `foo`
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.save_prompt({ content: "...refined...", replaces: "<P1.id>" })` from a `/mcp/foo` connection
- **THEN** in a single transaction: `P1.deleted_at` SHALL be set to the current timestamp; a new row `P2` SHALL be inserted with `P2.replaces = ["<P1.id>"]`
- **AND** the response SHALL include `{ ok: true, id: "<P2.id>", replaces: ["<P1.id>"] }`

#### Scenario: `memory.save_prompt` rejects refine when the predecessor is not in the active scope

- **GIVEN** a prompt `P1` belonging to project `foo`
- **WHEN** the agent (on a `/mcp/bar` connection) calls `memory.save_prompt({ content: "...", replaces: "<P1.id>" })`
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `prompt_scope_mismatch`
- **AND** `P1` SHALL remain active

#### Scenario: `memory.save_prompt` rejects refine when the predecessor is already deleted

- **GIVEN** a prompt `P1` with `deleted_at IS NOT NULL`
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.save_prompt({ content: "...", replaces: "<P1.id>" })`
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `prompt_already_deleted`
- **AND** no new row SHALL be inserted

#### Scenario: `memory.save_prompt` rejects refine when the predecessor does not exist

- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.save_prompt({ content: "...", replaces: "01HVALIDLOOKINGBUTUNKNOWN" })`
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `prompt_not_found`

#### Scenario: `memory.save_prompt` plain save (no tags, no replaces)

- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.save_prompt({ content: "save me", title: "remember to save" })` with no tags and no replaces
- **THEN** the call SHALL succeed and the row SHALL have `tags = NULL`, `replaces = NULL`
- **AND** the response SHALL be `{ ok: true, id: <ulid>, createdAt: <ts> }`

#### Scenario: `memory.save_prompt` rejects calls missing `title`

- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.save_prompt({ content: "save me" })` without a `title`
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `invalid_input` (zod validation failure: title is required)

#### Scenario: The description restrains when the tool is called

- **WHEN** the `memory.save_prompt` tool description is retrieved via `tools/list`
- **THEN** it SHALL state that the prompt must be reusable
- **AND** it SHALL forbid calling the tool routinely
- **AND** it SHALL name `memory.save` and `memory.session_summary` as the destinations for the adjacent intents
- **AND** it SHALL NOT invite a call on the grounds that the user stated a goal

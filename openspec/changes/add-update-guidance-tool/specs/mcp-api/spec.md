## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The MCP server MUST expose a read-only `memory.about` update-guidance tool

The server SHALL register a `memory.about` tool that returns Rembric update guidance as structured data. The tool SHALL take no input parameters, SHALL be read-only (no database access, no persistence, no mutation of any kind), and SHALL be idempotent. Its registered description SHALL contain the keywords `update` and `upgrade` and reference plugins so an agent selects it when the operator asks how to update or upgrade Rembric.

The tool acts as the cross-client equivalent of a Claude-Code skill: it is the portable surface — reachable from all four supported clients — that hands the operator the commands to run. It SHALL be **guidance-only**: it returns command strings for the operator to run and SHALL NOT execute `curl`, `sh`, `docker`, or any shell command itself.

The response SHALL be split into two axes that are never conflated:

- `server`: an object containing the running server version (the value of `REMBRIC_VERSION`), a human-readable note that this is the server (which runs wherever the tool executes, e.g. the operator's VPS), and the server update path on that host (`docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`). This axis SHALL NOT claim anything about client plugin state.
- `plugins`: an object containing the canonical TUI-installer commands — a **read-only status command** (`… --status --json`) that reports the server and each plugin's installed-vs-available version with a per-agent `action` (`none`/`update`/`ahead`/`unknown`), the interactive entrypoint (`curl -fsSL <install-url> | sh`), the update-all variant (`… --action=update`), and a subset example (`… --action=update --agent=<a,b>`) — together with an explicit note that plugins are installed per client machine, that this server cannot see them, that the operator runs the command on each machine where Rembric is used, and that the operator should run the status command first and update only where `action` is `update`.

The status command SHALL be the installer's existing read-only `--status --json` mode; the tool SHALL NOT compute installed-vs-available state itself (that detection is client-side and owned by the installer). The status command SHALL NOT include `--action=update` or any mutating flag.

The `plugins` command strings SHALL be derived from the canonical installer entrypoint and flags defined by the `tui-installer` capability; the tool SHALL NOT fork or hand-edit the installer's flag set. The `server` update command SHALL NOT duplicate the dashboard-driven one-click flow owned by the `self-update` capability; `memory.about` only surfaces the manual host command and the running version.

#### Scenario: A client calls memory.about

- **WHEN** an authenticated MCP client calls `memory.about` with no arguments
- **THEN** the tool SHALL return a result containing a `server` object whose version equals the running `REMBRIC_VERSION` and a `plugins` object containing the installer command(s)
- **AND** the result SHALL NOT trigger any database read or write

#### Scenario: The two axes are labeled and never conflated

- **WHEN** the tool result is inspected
- **THEN** the `plugins` axis SHALL include a note stating that plugins live on each client machine and that the server cannot see them
- **AND** the `server` version SHALL NOT be presented as an indicator of whether any client plugin is up to date

#### Scenario: The tool is guidance-only and never executes

- **WHEN** `memory.about` is invoked
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT spawn a process, run `curl`/`sh`/`docker`, or perform any side effect; it SHALL only return command strings for the operator to run

#### Scenario: The plugins commands match the canonical installer entrypoint

- **WHEN** the tool's `plugins` command strings are compared against the canonical installer entrypoint defined by the `tui-installer` capability
- **THEN** the interactive and `--action=update` invocations SHALL reference that same entrypoint and flag set (no forked URL or flags)

#### Scenario: The tool offers a read-only status command to check before updating

- **WHEN** the `plugins` axis is inspected
- **THEN** it SHALL include a `status` command using the installer's `--status --json` mode that references the canonical entrypoint
- **AND** that command SHALL NOT contain `--action=update` or any other mutating flag
- **AND** the `plugins.note` SHALL direct the operator to run the status command first and update only where the reported `action` is `update`

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The MCP `initialize` response MUST ship a protocol-teaching `instructions` block

When the MCP server is constructed, its `instructions` field SHALL be populated with a scope-aware string that teaches the agent when to call each tool. The string SHALL be 800 characters or fewer.

The instructions SHALL include:

1. The session-close protocol sentence directing the agent to call `memory.session_summary({title, summary})` before declaring work "done". The sentence SHALL describe the title constraint (≤100 chars, descriptive of what was actually worked on — NOT the cwd, NOT generic), the summary structure (Goal · Discoveries · Accomplished · Next Steps · Files), AND the summary length cap (≤2000 chars). The cap MUST be present inline so the agent budgets for it on the first attempt; this is verified by the same length test that enforces the 800-character ceiling.
2. **The post-compact recovery clause** — a short instruction directing the agent that after any compaction event, when the compacted summary lacks specific detail (exact file paths, prior decisions, concrete error messages), it MUST call `memory.context` (or `memory.search` for keyword lookup) BEFORE responding to the user's pending prompt. The phrasing SHALL stay concise (≤60 chars of new content) so the total stays under the 800-char cap.
3. **The update-guidance pointer** — a short clause naming `memory.about` as the tool to call when the operator asks how to update or upgrade Rembric (server or plugins). The phrasing SHALL stay concise (≤40 chars of new content) so the total stays under the 800-char cap.

#### Scenario: An MCP client connects on `/mcp/<slug>`

- **WHEN** the `initialize` handshake completes against `/mcp/my-project`
- **THEN** the `InitializeResult.instructions` SHALL contain references to `memory.save`, `memory.search`, `memory.session_summary`, AND `memory.context` (the new post-compact recovery clause) plus a note indicating the connection is project-scoped to `'my-project'` and that `scope='global'` will be rejected
- **AND** the instructions SHALL contain the substring `memory.session_summary` and the substring `title` and a reference to "before" (referring to before declaring done)
- **AND** the instructions SHALL contain the substring `2000` (the summary length cap)
- **AND** the instructions SHALL contain the substring `memory.context` (the post-compact recovery clause)
- **AND** the instructions SHALL contain the substring `memory.about` (the update-guidance pointer)

#### Scenario: An MCP client connects on `/mcp` without a project

- **WHEN** the `initialize` handshake completes against `/mcp`
- **THEN** the `InitializeResult.instructions` SHALL contain the same protocol triggers (including the session-close protocol sentence, the `2000`-char cap, the memory.context post-compact recovery clause, AND the `memory.about` update-guidance pointer) and a note indicating the connection is global-scope and that project memories require opening `/mcp/<slug>` or sending `X-Rembric-Project`

#### Scenario: Instructions length is checked at build time

- **WHEN** the test suite runs against both `/mcp` and `/mcp/<slug>` variants of `buildInstructions(ctx)`
- **THEN** both outputs SHALL be 800 characters or fewer (unchanged cap — the 2000-char summary cap mention, the memory.context post-compact clause, AND the memory.about update-guidance pointer MUST all fit within the existing budget)
- **AND** both outputs SHALL contain the substring `2000`
- **AND** both outputs SHALL contain the substring `memory.context`
- **AND** both outputs SHALL contain the substring `memory.about`

#### Scenario: A client that does not consume `instructions` connects

- **WHEN** an MCP client ignores the `instructions` field
- **THEN** every tool SHALL still function normally (the field is informational only)
- **AND** `memory.about` SHALL remain discoverable through the MCP tool manifest regardless of whether the client consumed the `instructions` pointer

#### Scenario: instructions.test.ts asserts the new memory.context clause is present

- **WHEN** `apps/server/src/mcp/instructions.test.ts` runs against `buildInstructions({requestedSlug: 'demo'})` and `buildInstructions({requestedSlug: null})`
- **THEN** both outputs SHALL contain the substring `memory.context`
- **AND** both outputs SHALL contain the substring `memory.about`
- **AND** both outputs SHALL be ≤800 chars
- **AND** existing assertions for `memory.session_summary`, `memory.save`, `memory.search`, scope notes, etc. SHALL continue to pass

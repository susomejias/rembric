## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The MCP server MUST expose four session-lifecycle tools

The `/mcp` and `/mcp/<slug>` endpoints SHALL register the tools `memory.session_start`, `memory.session_end`, `memory.session_summary` and `memory.session_resume` with the following contracts. The tools are split by responsibility: `memory.session_start` opens a session, `memory.session_summary` writes summary/title without transitioning, `memory.session_end` is the state transition out of `active`, and `memory.session_resume` is the sole transition back into it.

`memory.session_start` SHALL NOT always insert a row. When an `active` session already exists for the caller's `(tokenId, projectId)` on this transport — the ordinary case, because every supported host registers the session over HTTP before the agent runs — the call SHALL adopt that row instead of minting a second one, and SHALL report which of the two happened in a REQUIRED `reused` field: `true` when an existing row was adopted, `false` when a row was inserted. `reused` is the only signal distinguishing "you are now attached to the host's session" from "you just created a parallel session", which is the question a defensive `memory.session_start` call is asking. Its `outputSchema` SHALL mark it required, and the tool's description SHALL name it and state what `true` means (see "A tool's description and its response MUST agree, and neither may promise an unreachable state"): a required field the description omits from a closed-form `Returns: { … }` list is undocumented surface on the one channel the model reads.

`memory.session_summary` SHALL validate `summary` against the single canonical cap exported from `apps/server/src/services/agent-sessions.ts` (`SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS`, currently `10000`). The MCP zod schema SHALL be `summary: z.string().min(1).max(SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS)` so overflow is rejected at the transport boundary with `invalid_input` before the tool body runs. The rejected agent SHALL receive an error whose message contains the decimal string of `SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS` so it can retry with a tighter body on the first attempt.

`memory.session_summary` and `memory.session_end` SHALL NOT reject a call because the resolved row is in a terminal state. `memory.session_summary` SHALL apply its summary/title write subject to the `final` precedence rules regardless of `status`; `memory.session_end` takes no summary/title arguments, so on a terminal row it SHALL be a pure no-op returning the existing `ended_at`. Neither SHALL mutate `status`, `ended_at` or `last_activity_at` on a terminal row — see the `sessions` capability, "Terminal session rows MUST accept late summary and title writes, and MUST NOT change status except through `resume`". `session_already_ended` SHALL NOT be a possible error code for either tool. This matters because the plugin's `PreCompact`, `SessionStart:compact` and `Stop` nudges instruct the agent to call `memory.session_summary`, and the stale-active retirement sweep can have flipped the row to `abandoned` (the documented steady state for two of the clients) before the agent gets there.

`memory.session_summary`'s response SHALL carry a REQUIRED `applied: boolean` field. `applied` is `true` when the summary/title write landed on the row (whether the row was `active` or terminal without a prior curated summary). `applied` is `false` when the terminal first-curated-stands precedence rule blocked the write: the row is terminal (`ended` or `abandoned`), `summary_final` was already `true`, and the incoming curated summary was discarded. When `applied` is `false`, the response SHALL additionally carry `discardReason: 'terminal_final'` — the only discard reason today — to name the specific rule that blocked the write. When `applied` is `true`, `discardReason` SHALL be omitted from the response. The `outputSchema` SHALL declare `applied` as required (`z.boolean()`) and `discardReason` as optional (`z.string().optional()`). This field is the entire remedy available on the MCP surface: the row cannot be repaired, the first-curated-stands rule cannot be changed (there is no `replaces` chain for sessions, so losing a curated handoff is unrecoverable), and returning an error would violate the "SHALL NOT reject a call because the resolved row is in a terminal state" clause above.

`memory.session_end`'s response SHALL carry a REQUIRED `applied: boolean` field. `applied` is `true` when the call transitioned an `active` row to `ended`. `applied` is `false` when the row was already terminal (`ended` or `abandoned`) and the call was a no-op. The `outputSchema` SHALL declare `applied` as required (`z.boolean()`). This makes the two session-lifecycle write tools consistent: both report whether the call achieved a state change.

`memory.session_resume` SHALL accept `{ sessionId: string }` with `sessionId` REQUIRED, and SHALL call `AgentSessionsService.resume` (specified in the `sessions` capability) with the request's token id. Its response SHALL be `{ ok: true, sessionId, status: 'active', startedAt, resumedAt, previousStatus, previousEndedAt, title }`, where `previousStatus` is the row's `status` immediately before the call and `previousEndedAt` is the `ended_at` the call discarded (`null` when the row was already `active`). Those two fields are the ONLY report of a value the server does not retain, so the tool's `outputSchema` SHALL mark them required and the description SHALL name them. `resumedAt` SHALL be the row's effective last activity after the call — the instant of the resume on the transition path, and the row's PRIOR activity on the already-`active` no-op path, since that path writes nothing by design. `resumedAt` SHALL NOT be read as "the instant this call ran": `previousStatus` is what distinguishes a transition from a no-op, and the tool description SHALL say so.

`sessionId` SHALL have no fallback resolution on `memory.session_resume`. Unlike the other three tools it SHALL NOT consult the `SessionRouter` entry, and SHALL NOT consult the sole-active-session lookup. Both fallbacks are structurally unavailable — `memory.session_end` cleared the router binding on its way out, and the active-session lookup filters `status = 'active'`, which the resume target by definition is not — so any fallback would have to select a terminal row by recency, precisely the heuristic the `sessions` capability's "`findActiveForTransport` MUST NOT guess under concurrent ambiguity" refuses. A call omitting `sessionId` SHALL be rejected at the zod boundary with `invalid_input`, never resolved to a guess.

`memory.session_end` clears the `SessionRouter` transport binding for `(tokenId, mcpSessionId)` ONLY when the row it resolved is not `abandoned`. Before terminal writes were admitted, `end()` threw on an `abandoned` row and the clear was unreachable, so the binding survived; clearing it now would drop every later `memory.save` on that transport to `session_id = NULL`. That prior behaviour SHALL be preserved: ending an `abandoned` row SHALL leave the binding intact, ending an `active` or `ended` row SHALL clear it.

`memory.session_resume` SHALL set that binding, and this is load-bearing rather than incidental. On success it SHALL call the same `SessionRouter.setActiveSession(tokenId, mcpSessionId, sessionId)` that `memory.session_start` calls, so the resuming transport resolves its session by an explicit pin rather than by the ambiguous-resolution fallback. Without the pin a resumed row is only reachable through the sole-active-session lookup, which returns nothing whenever a second session is concurrently live under the same `(token, project)`. It SHALL set the binding on the already-`active` no-op path too, since re-pinning is the useful half of a defensive call. It SHALL NOT set `setActiveProject`: resume names a session, not a project, and the project is whatever the connection already resolved.

Session resolution is unchanged for the other three tools and SHALL remain status-aware where it already is: `memory.session_summary` resolves its target from an explicit `sessionId`, else the transport's `SessionRouter` entry, else the unambiguous `active` session for the caller's `(token_id, project_id)`. The third source SHALL continue to consider only `active` rows, so an agent that supplies neither an explicit id nor a router-mapped session SHALL receive `session_not_found` rather than having its write attached to a closed session picked by recency.

#### Scenario: `memory.session_start` opens a new session

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_start` with `{ agent?: string, description?: string }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL insert a `sessions` row with `status = 'active'`, `started_at = now`, the provided `agent` (or `'unknown'`), `token_id` from the request context, `project_id` from the request scope, and a placeholder `title` of the form `basename(cwd) · HH:MM UTC` with `title_final = false`; **AND** the response SHALL be `{ sessionId, scope, projectId, startedAt, title, reused }`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_end` ends a session without summary

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_end` with `{ sessionId: string }` for an active session
- **THEN** the server SHALL set `status = 'ended'` and `ended_at = now` on that row, leave `summary` and `title` unchanged, and SHALL return `{ ok: true, sessionId, endedAt, applied: true }`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_end` is idempotent on already-ended sessions

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_end` on a row whose `status` is already `'ended'`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ ok: true, sessionId, endedAt, applied: false }` with the existing `ended_at` and SHALL NOT mutate the row

#### Scenario: `memory.session_end` is idempotent on abandoned sessions

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_end` on a row whose `status` is `'abandoned'` with `ended_at = E`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ ok: true, sessionId, endedAt: E, applied: false }`, SHALL leave `status = 'abandoned'` and `ended_at = E` untouched, and SHALL NOT return `session_already_ended`
- **AND** the `SessionRouter` binding for the calling transport SHALL remain pointing at that session, so a subsequent `memory.save` on the same transport still auto-attaches its `session_id`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_end` on an active session clears the transport binding

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_end` on an `active` row and the call transitions it to `ended`
- **THEN** the `SessionRouter` entry for `(tokenId, mcpSessionId)` SHALL be cleared, as before this requirement's revision

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` writes summary and title without ending the session

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_summary` with `{ sessionId?: string, summary: string, title?: string }` and `summary.length <= SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS`
- **THEN** the server SHALL resolve `sessionId` from the active MCP transport mapping when omitted, write `summary` with `summary_final = true`, write `title` (when provided, after validating length ≤100) with `title_final = true`, leave `status`/`ended_at` unchanged, and return `{ ok: true, sessionId, summary, title, summaryFinal: true, titleFinal: <true|false>, applied: true }`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` succeeds on a session the sweep already abandoned

- **GIVEN** the agent's session was flipped to `status = 'abandoned'` with `ended_at = E` and `last_activity_at = L` by stale-active retirement while the conversation was still open, and the agent knows its `sessionId` (the plugin's nudge injects it)
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.session_summary({ sessionId, summary, title })`
- **THEN** the call SHALL succeed and return `{ ok: true, sessionId, summary, title, summaryFinal: true, applied: true }`
- **AND** the row SHALL retain `status = 'abandoned'`, `ended_at = E` and `last_activity_at = L`
- **AND** the call SHALL NOT return `session_already_ended`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` succeeds on an ended session

- **GIVEN** a row whose `status = 'ended'` with `ended_at = E` and `summary_final = false` (no curated summary written yet)
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.session_summary({ sessionId, summary })`
- **THEN** the call SHALL succeed with `summaryFinal: true` and `applied: true`, and `status`/`ended_at` SHALL be unchanged

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` with no resolvable session still reports `session_not_found`

- **GIVEN** the agent passes no explicit `sessionId`, the transport has no `SessionRouter` entry, and the only candidate row for its `(token_id, project_id)` is `abandoned`
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.session_summary({ summary })`
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `session_not_found` (NOT `session_already_ended`, and NOT silently attached to the abandoned row)

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` may be called multiple times; the latest call wins

- **GIVEN** an `active` session whose `summary_final = true` from a prior `memory.session_summary({summary: "A"})` call
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.session_summary({summary: "B"})` again
- **THEN** `summary` SHALL be replaced with "B" (last-final-wins among final writes on active rows) and `applied` SHALL be `true`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` discards a second curated write on a terminal row

- **GIVEN** a terminal session (`status = 'ended'` or `'abandoned'`) whose `summary_final = true` from a prior curated write with summary "A"
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.session_summary({ sessionId, summary: "B" })`
- **THEN** the response SHALL carry `ok: true`, `summary: "A"` (the stored value, unchanged), `summaryFinal: true`, `applied: false`, and `discardReason: 'terminal_final'`
- **AND** the session row SHALL be unchanged in every column

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` discards a second curated title on a terminal row

- **GIVEN** a terminal session whose `title_final = true` from a prior curated write with title "First"
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.session_summary({ sessionId, summary: "new summary", title: "Second" })`
- **THEN** the response SHALL carry `title: "First"` (the stored value, unchanged), `titleFinal: true`, `applied: false`, and `discardReason: 'terminal_final'`
- **AND** the session row SHALL be unchanged in every column

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` discards summary but applies title on a terminal row

- **GIVEN** a terminal session whose `summary_final = true` and `title_final = false`
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.session_summary({ sessionId, summary: "B", title: "New Title" })`
- **THEN** the response SHALL carry `summary: "A"` (unchanged), `summaryFinal: true`, `title: "New Title"` (applied), `titleFinal: true`, `applied: false`, and `discardReason: 'terminal_final'`
- **AND** the summary column SHALL be unchanged but the title column SHALL reflect the new value

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` rejects empty summary

- **WHEN** the agent submits `summary: ""` or whitespace-only
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `invalid_input`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` rejects title over 100 chars

- **WHEN** the agent submits `title: "A".repeat(101)`
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `invalid_input`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` rejects summary over `SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS`

- **WHEN** the agent submits `summary: "A".repeat(SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS + 1)` (one char over the cap)
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected at the zod boundary with code `invalid_input`
- **AND** the error message SHALL contain the decimal string of `SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS` so the agent can deduce the cap and retry with a tighter body on the first attempt
- **AND** the session row SHALL NOT be mutated (no partial write, `summary_final` unchanged)

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` accepts summary of exactly `SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS`

- **WHEN** the agent submits `summary: "A".repeat(SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS)`
- **THEN** the call SHALL succeed and the row SHALL have `summary` of length `SUMMARY_MAX_CHARS` with `summary_final = true` and `applied: true`

#### Scenario: A session-lifecycle tool targets a session owned by a different token

- **WHEN** any of the four tools is called with a `sessionId` whose `token_id` does not match the caller's token
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `session_not_found` (never `forbidden`, to avoid information disclosure)

#### Scenario: A second `memory.session_start` adopts the first session and says so

- **GIVEN** a connection with no active session for its `(tokenId, projectId)`
- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_start` twice in a row on that connection
- **THEN** the first response SHALL carry `reused: false` and the second SHALL carry `reused: true`
- **AND** both responses SHALL carry the SAME `sessionId` — the second call SHALL NOT insert a second `sessions` row
- **AND** the `sessions` row count for that `(tokenId, projectId)` SHALL be 1 after both calls, which is the control that `reused: true` describes adoption rather than a coincidence of ids

#### Scenario: `memory.session_start`'s description names every required output field

- **WHEN** an MCP client retrieves the tool description for `memory.session_start` via `tools/list`
- **THEN** the description's `Returns:` enumeration SHALL name every field its `outputSchema` marks required, including `title` and `reused`
- **AND** the description SHALL state that `reused: true` means the call adopted the host's already-active session rather than starting one
- **AND** a CI test SHALL compare the description against the `outputSchema`'s required list, so a field added to the schema without a description update fails the build

#### Scenario: `memory.session_resume` returns an ended session to active

- **GIVEN** session `<S>` owned by the calling token, `status='ended'` with `ended_at = E`, in the connection's project
- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_resume` with `{ sessionId: <S> }`
- **THEN** the response SHALL be `{ ok: true, sessionId: <S>, status: 'active', startedAt, resumedAt, previousStatus: 'ended', previousEndedAt: E, title }`
- **AND** the row SHALL have `status='active'` and `ended_at IS NULL`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_resume` returns an abandoned session to active identically

- **GIVEN** session `<S>` owned by the calling token, `status='abandoned'` with `ended_at = E`
- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_resume` with `{ sessionId: <S> }`
- **THEN** the response SHALL carry `previousStatus: 'abandoned'`, `previousEndedAt: E` and `status: 'active'`
- **AND** the row SHALL be indistinguishable in every column from the same row resumed out of `ended`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_resume` pins the transport binding

- **GIVEN** an MCP transport whose `SessionRouter` entry carries no session (the state `memory.session_end` leaves behind)
- **WHEN** the client calls `memory.session_resume` with `{ sessionId: <S> }` and it succeeds
- **THEN** the `SessionRouter` entry for `(tokenId, mcpSessionId)` SHALL point at `<S>`
- **AND** a subsequent `memory.save` on that transport, with no explicit `sessionId`, SHALL persist `session_id = <S>`
- **AND** that SHALL hold even when a second `active` session exists for the same `(token_id, project_id)`, which is the case the sole-active-session fallback refuses to resolve

#### Scenario: `memory.session_resume` refuses a call with no `sessionId`

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_resume` with `{}`
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected at the zod boundary with code `invalid_input`
- **AND** no session SHALL be resolved from the `SessionRouter` entry or by recency, and no row SHALL be mutated

#### Scenario: `memory.session_resume` refuses an unknown property

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_resume` with `{ sessionId: <S>, epoch: 3 }`
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with `invalid_input` rather than having the unknown property silently stripped, because every tool's input schema is registered strict

#### Scenario: `memory.session_resume` targets a session in another project

- **GIVEN** session `<S>` owned by the calling token but belonging to a project other than the one this connection resolved
- **WHEN** the client calls `memory.session_resume` with `{ sessionId: <S> }`
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with `session_not_found` and the row SHALL NOT be mutated

#### Scenario: `memory.session_resume` on an already-active session succeeds and re-pins

- **GIVEN** session `<S>` with `status='active'` and `last_activity_at = L`
- **WHEN** the client calls `memory.session_resume` with `{ sessionId: <S> }`
- **THEN** the call SHALL succeed with `previousStatus: 'active'` and `previousEndedAt: null`
- **AND** the row SHALL NOT be mutated, so `last_activity_at` SHALL still be `L`
- **AND** the `SessionRouter` entry SHALL nonetheless point at `<S>`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_start` adopts a resumed session rather than minting a second row

- **GIVEN** session `<S>` was resumed and is the only `active` row for the caller's `(token_id, project_id)`
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.session_start`
- **THEN** the response SHALL carry `sessionId = <S>` and `reused: true`
- **AND** the `sessions` row count for that `(token_id, project_id)` SHALL be unchanged, which is the control that adoption happened rather than a coincidence of ids

#### Scenario: `memory.session_resume`'s description names every required output field

- **WHEN** an MCP client retrieves the tool description for `memory.session_resume` via `tools/list`
- **THEN** the description's `Returns:` enumeration SHALL name every field its `outputSchema` marks required, including `previousStatus` and `previousEndedAt`
- **AND** the description SHALL state that `previousEndedAt` is not retained on the row after the call
- **AND** the CI test that compares each description against its `outputSchema`'s required list SHALL cover this tool

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The MCP server MUST expose three session-lifecycle tools

The `/mcp` and `/mcp/<slug>` endpoints SHALL register the tools `memory.session_start`, `memory.session_end`, and `memory.session_summary` with the following contracts. The tools are split by responsibility: `memory.session_start` opens a session, `memory.session_summary` writes summary/title without transitioning, `memory.session_end` is the sole state transition. This is a behaviour change from the prior contract where `memory.session_summary` ended the session as a side effect.

#### Scenario: `memory.session_start` opens a new session

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_start` with `{ agent?: string, description?: string }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL insert a `sessions` row with `status = 'active'`, `started_at = now`, the provided `agent` (or `'unknown'`), `token_id` from the request context, `project_id` from the request scope, and a placeholder `title` of the form `basename(cwd) · HH:MM UTC` with `title_final = false`; **AND** the response SHALL be `{ sessionId, scope, startedAt, title }`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_end` ends a session without summary

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_end` with `{ sessionId: string }` for an active session
- **THEN** the server SHALL set `status = 'ended'` and `ended_at = now` on that row, leave `summary` and `title` unchanged, and SHALL return `{ ok: true, endedAt }`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_end` is idempotent on already-ended sessions

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_end` on a row whose `status` is already `'ended'`
- **THEN** the server SHALL return `{ ok: true, endedAt }` with the existing `ended_at` and SHALL NOT mutate the row

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` writes summary and title without ending the session

- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `memory.session_summary` with `{ sessionId?: string, summary: string, title?: string }`
- **THEN** the server SHALL resolve `sessionId` from the active MCP transport mapping when omitted, write `summary` with `summary_final = true`, write `title` (when provided, after validating length ≤100) with `title_final = true`, leave `status`/`ended_at` unchanged, and return `{ ok: true, sessionId, summary, title, summaryFinal: true, titleFinal: <true|false> }`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` may be called multiple times; the latest call wins

- **GIVEN** a session whose `summary_final = true` from a prior `memory.session_summary({summary: "A"})` call
- **WHEN** the agent calls `memory.session_summary({summary: "B"})` again
- **THEN** `summary` SHALL be replaced with "B" (last-final-wins among final writes)

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` rejects empty summary

- **WHEN** the agent submits `summary: ""` or whitespace-only
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `invalid_input`

#### Scenario: `memory.session_summary` rejects title over 100 chars

- **WHEN** the agent submits `title: "A".repeat(101)`
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `invalid_input`

#### Scenario: A session-lifecycle tool targets a session owned by a different token

- **WHEN** any of the three tools is called with a `sessionId` whose `token_id` does not match the caller's token
- **THEN** the call SHALL be rejected with code `session_not_found` (never `forbidden`, to avoid information disclosure)

### Requirement: The MCP `initialize` response MUST ship a protocol-teaching `instructions` block

When the MCP server is constructed, its `instructions` field SHALL be populated with a scope-aware string that teaches the agent when to call each tool. The string SHALL be 800 characters or fewer.

The instructions SHALL include the session-close protocol sentence directing the agent to call `memory.session_summary({title, summary})` before declaring work "done". The sentence SHALL describe the title constraint (≤100 chars, descriptive of what was actually worked on — NOT the cwd, NOT generic) and the summary structure (Goal · Discoveries · Accomplished · Next Steps · Files).

#### Scenario: An MCP client connects on `/mcp/<slug>`

- **WHEN** the `initialize` handshake completes against `/mcp/my-project`
- **THEN** the `InitializeResult.instructions` SHALL contain references to `memory.save`, `memory.search`, and `memory.session_summary` plus a note indicating the connection is project-scoped to `'my-project'` and that `scope='global'` will be rejected
- **AND** the instructions SHALL contain the substring `memory.session_summary` and the substring `title` and a reference to "before" (referring to before declaring done)

#### Scenario: An MCP client connects on `/mcp` without a project

- **WHEN** the `initialize` handshake completes against `/mcp`
- **THEN** the `InitializeResult.instructions` SHALL contain the same protocol triggers (including the session-close protocol sentence) and a note indicating the connection is global-scope and that project memories require opening `/mcp/<slug>` or sending `X-Rembric-Project`

#### Scenario: Instructions length is checked at build time

- **WHEN** the test suite runs against both `/mcp` and `/mcp/<slug>` variants of `buildInstructions(ctx)`
- **THEN** both outputs SHALL be 800 characters or fewer

#### Scenario: A client that does not consume `instructions` connects

- **WHEN** an MCP client ignores the `instructions` field
- **THEN** every tool SHALL still function normally (the field is informational only)
